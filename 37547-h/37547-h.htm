<p>The worst of being a Christmas Child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
is that you don&rsquo;t get birthday presents, but
only Christmas ones. Old Naylor, who was
Father&rsquo;s coachman, and had a great gruff
voice that came from his boots and was
rather frightening, used to ask how I expected
to grow up without proper birthdays, and I
thought I might have to stay little always.
When I told Father this he laughed, but a
moment later he grew quite grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen, Chris,&rdquo; he said. And then he
took me on his knee&mdash;I was a small chap
then&mdash;and told me things that made me forget
old Naylor, and wish and wish that Mother
could have stayed with us. The angels had
wanted her, Father explained; well, we
wanted her too, and there were plenty of
angels in heaven, anyway. When I said this
Father gave me a great squeeze and put me
down, and I tried to be glad that I was a
Christmas child. But I wasn&rsquo;t really until
a long time afterwards, when I had found
the Fairy Ring, and met the Queen of the
Fairies.</p>

<p>This was how it happened. Father and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
lived at one end of a big town, in a funny old
house with an orchard behind it, where the
sparrows ate the cherries and the apple trees
didn&rsquo;t flower. Once upon a time, said Father,
there had been country all round it, but the
streets and the roads had grown and grown
until they drove the country away, and now
there were trams outside the door, and not a
field to be seen. I often thought that our
garden must be sorry to be so crowded up,
and that this was why it wouldn&rsquo;t grow anything
but weedy nasturtiums and evening
primroses.</p>

<p>Father is a doctor, and most awfully clever.
If you cut off the top of your finger, he&rsquo;d pop
it on again in no time, and he used to cure all
sorts of illnesses with different coloured
medicines he made himself behind a screen.</p>

<p>But though he had lots and lots of
patients&mdash;sometimes the surgery was full of
them, &rsquo;specially on cold nights when there
was a fire&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t seem to have much
money to give him, and sometimes they ran
away with their furniture in the night so&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
not to pay their bills. This worried Father
dreadfully, and even Santa Claus was scared
away by the things he said. On Christmas
Eve the old fellow quite forgot to fill my
stocking. It was all limp and empty when I
woke in the morning, and if I hadn&rsquo;t remembered
that when I grew up I was going to be
a Commander-in-Chief, I should never have
swallowed that lump in my throat.</p>

<p>Father couldn&rsquo;t even take me to hear &ldquo;Hark
The Herald Angels&rdquo; at the big church down
the road that day, for someone sent for him in
a hurry, and when he didn&rsquo;t come in for
dinner, I wished it wasn&rsquo;t Christmas at all.
Nancy Blake, who kept house for us and was
most stingy over raisins, banged the kitchen
door when I said I would make her some
toffee, and I couldn&rsquo;t find anything else to do.
I looked at all my books and pretended I was
a soldier in a lonely fort; then I thought I
would make up medicine myself, so&rsquo;s to save
Father trouble when he came home. But I
burnt my fingers with some nasty stuff in a
green bottle, and it hurt a good deal. So I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
determined to go to meet him, and tell him
what I&rsquo;d done.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/ibw010.jpg" width="235" height="322" alt="&ldquo;Nancy Blake.&rdquo;" title="&ldquo;Nancy Blake&rdquo;" />
</div>

<p>The trams were running as usual, and as
I had a penny
left out of my
pocket money&mdash;I
hadn&rsquo;t spent
it before as it
had got stuck in
some bulls&rsquo; eyes&mdash;I
took the car
to the corner;
then I jumped
out and walked.
There wasn&rsquo;t a
sign of Father
all down the
road, and I
remembered at
last that he had
said he must look in at the Hospital, which
was in quite a different direction. I should
have gone home then, if it hadn&rsquo;t been so dull
with no one but Nancy Blake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be back until tea time anyhow,&rdquo;
I thought, and I made up my mind to be a
boy scout, and go and explore.</p>

<p>It was a splendid day, and the roofs of the
shops and houses glittered from millions of
tiny points, just as you see on Christmas
cards. I walked on and on, feeling gladder
every moment, for my fingers had left off
hurting me and I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t be far
from the woods, which were just outside the
town. I had been there once with Father,
and it was lovely; so I hurried on as quickly
as I could.</p>

<p>When I got there they made me think of
Fairyland. The trees were sparkling with
the same frost-diamonds I had noticed on the
roofs, and through the criss-cross branches
above my head the sky was as blue as blue.
A jolly little robin was twittering in a
bush, enjoying himself no end; his bright
red breast reminded me of the holly I had
stuck over Father&rsquo;s mantelpiece, and I
began to feel sad again. For it did seem
hard lines that though Christmas was my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
birthday, no one, not even Father, had
thought of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish that I hadn&rsquo;t been born on
Christmas Day!&rdquo; I said aloud, when I had
reached the very heart of the wood, and I sat
down to rest on the stump of a tree close to a
little circle of bright green. It was here I
had come that day with Father, and he had
told me that though it was called a &ldquo;Fairy
Ring,&rdquo; it was really made by the spread of
a very small fungus, or mushroom. I liked
the idea of the fairy ring much better, and as
I touched it with my foot I wished again that
I wasn&rsquo;t a Christmas child. And then I
heard a sigh.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t the robin, for he was still
twittering on his bush, and it wasn&rsquo;t the
wind, for the air was quite sheltered behind
the bank, which was sweet with wild
thyme in summer. The next moment I
heard another sigh, and this seemed to come
from a frond of bracken just outside the fairy
ring. It was brown and withered, but the
frost had silvered it all over, and as I looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
at it I saw the loveliest little creature you can
imagine clinging to the stem. She was only
about three inches high, but her tiny form
was full of grace, and her eyes so bright and
beautiful that they shone like stars. Her
hair was the palest silver-gold, and she had
a crown of diamonds and an amethyst wand
that sparkled when she moved it. The scarf
wreathed round her shoulders flashed all the
colours of mother-of-pearl, and throwing it
from her she hummed to herself a little song
about violets and eglantine, and sweet musk
roses. Her notes were as clear as the lark&rsquo;s,
and as if she had called them, more Fairies
showed amidst the bracken.</p>

<p>They were lovely too, though not so lovely
as she. One was dressed in pink, like a pink
pea; another had a long grey coat, spangled
with drops of dew, while the third had wings
like a big grey moth, and the smallest Elf was
all in brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Titania who sings,&rdquo; chirped the
robin in my left ear; &ldquo;Titania, the Queen of
the Fairies, though some call her the fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Queen Mab!&rdquo; And he hopped to the foot of
the frond of bracken and made a funny little
duck with his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good bird!&rdquo; cried Titania, breaking off
her song. &ldquo;You, too, sing through the
winter gloom, and are here to welcome the
sweet o&rsquo; the year.&rdquo; Then she pointed her
gleaming wand at me, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Christmas child,&rdquo; she said reproachfully,
&ldquo;it is well that it was I who heard
you, and not my brave lord Oberon, who has
less patience with mortal folly. So you wish
you had not been born on Christmas Day?
Why, &rsquo;tis the day most blessed in all the
year&mdash;the day when the King of Kings sent
peace and goodwill to Man in the form of
the Christ Child. It is His birthday as
well as yours, and in memory of Him the
Fairies show themselves to Christmas children,
if they are pure in heart and word and
deed. Your Mother knew this, and she was
glad. She called you &lsquo;Chris&rsquo; to remind you
always which day you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then I was sure that I hadn&rsquo;t been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dreaming after all, though Nancy said, &ldquo;Stuff
and Nonsense,&rdquo; when I fancied that I had
seen those wee brown men busy about the
house on winter mornings, or flitting in
shadowy corners at night, before she lit the
gas. I had never spoken to them, for I
thought if I did they might run away; but I
was pleased to know they had been real.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would have seen us before,&rdquo; said
Titania, &ldquo;but you live in a big town, and
your eyes were dimmed with smoke and fog.
My dainty Elves love dales and streams, and
the depths of forests; in spring they throng the
meadows, decking the cowslips&rsquo; coats of gold
at early dawn with splotches of ruby, my
choicest favours, and hanging pearls in their
dainty ears. In summer they sleep in the
roseleaves, and ride behind the wings of
butterflies, while in winter they hush the
babble of the brooks, and powder the
branches of the trees with frost to hide their
nakedness. Away with you, Peas-blossom,
Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed! Go,
freeze the fingers of Father Time into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
glassy icicles, and forget not to seek for
crimson berries on which our friends the
birds may feed at morn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She clapped her hands, and the Fairies fled.
I wondered why she did not fall, since she no
longer clung to the frond of bracken; but her
tiny feet were firmly planted in the fork of a
leaf, and behind her glinted a pair of wings
which had been invisible before. As I watched
her I thought of a question I had often wanted
to ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do Fairies come from?&rdquo; I said,
hoping she would not be offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that is more than I
may tell you. But we were here, in these
very islands, long before the people of the
woods, and the white-haired Druids who
worshipped the God of the Oak. There were
spirits then, as now, in streams and rivers,
and sweet-voiced Sirens in the deep blue sea.
Some Fairies rode on magic horses, and some
were even smaller than I, and lived in the
ears of the yellow corn. Dagda then was
the King of the Fairies, a mighty spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
whose cauldron was supposed to be the vast
grey dome of the sky. Those were the days
of Witches, Dwarfs, and Giants, and little
people who lived in the hills, and many other
Fairies known by different names.</p>

<p>We are found in various guises all over
the world, but our home is said first to have
been in Persia. There dwelt the ancient
Jinn who haunted the mountain recesses and
the forest wilds ages before the first man trod
the earth. Here, too, were Deevs, malicious
creatures of terrible strength who warred
with our sisters, the Peries. These exquisite
creatures abode at Kâf, in the deep green
mountains of Chrysolite, the realm of Pleasure
and Delight, wherein was the beauteous Amber
City. Some day you may go to Persia, and
then, if you meet a Peri, she will tell you how
a mortal man once came to her sisters&rsquo; rescue,
and conquered the wicked Deevs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The thought of meeting a Peri took my
breath away, for I had read about them on
winter evenings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that wherever I go I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
see the Fairies, just as I see you now?&rdquo; I
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wherever you go!&rdquo; she said, nodding her
head, &ldquo;and soon I believe you will cross the
sea and travel through other lands. But
you must not think,&rdquo; she went on earnestly,
&ldquo;that the Fairies in your own country are less
worth knowing, for you might spend your life
in making friends with them, and yet have
much to learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t remember half of all that Titania
told me after this, but she spoke of fair White
Elves who live among the trees, and are ruled
by a King who rides abroad in a beautiful
little coach with trappings of gold and silver;
of mischievous Black Elves who live underground,
and haunt people with nasty tempers;
of Nymphs and Gnomes and sad-faced Trolls,
and of Brownies and Portunes and Pixies. I
should have liked to hear more about the
Brownies and Portunes, but it was fun to
learn how the Brownies play tricks on lazy
people who lie in bed and won&rsquo;t get up,
pulling the clothes right off them, and throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
these on the floor, and of how they help the
farmers&rsquo; wives to bake and brew if they are
clean and neat. Titania said that Fairies
dislike people who are untidy, and I hoped
that she hadn&rsquo;t seen my playbox or my chest
of drawers. I made up my mind that directly
I got home I would put them straight, and so
that she might not notice how red I had grown,
I asked her to tell me what Portunes were.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/ibw013.jpg" width="253" height="321" alt="The &ldquo;Portunes&rdquo; were queer creatures." title="The &ldquo;Portunes&rdquo; were queer creatures." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Queer little wrinkled creatures with faces
like old men,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They wear long
green coats covered with darns and patches,
and are only found now in the depths of the
country. They like to live on prosperous
farms, and though some of them are barely
an inch high, they can lift heavier weights
than the strongest labourer. Like the
Brownies, they can be mischievous as well as
helpful. A farmer once offended a Portune
by speaking disrespectfully of his kindred, and
the next time that the good man rode home
from market in the dusk, the little fellow
sprang on to the horse&rsquo;s reins, and guided
him into the bog. Both horse and man had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to flounder out as best they could, and the
farmer was careful henceforth to mind his
tongue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what
are Pixies
like?&rdquo; I asked.
She had said
that I reminded
her of one
of these, so of
course I was
curious about
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are
much taller
than we are,
and very fair,&rdquo;
answered Titania,
&ldquo;with
blue-grey eyes
like yours. If you want to meet them, you
must go to Devonshire, for it is there that
they make their home. They love the ferns
and the heather, and the rich red earth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
live in a Pixy-house in a rock. They, also,
are ruled by a King, who commands them as
I do my Elves and Fays, despatching them
hither and thither to do his will. Sometimes
he sends them down to the mines, to show the
men who work there where the richest lode is
to be found; and if the miners grumble, or are
discontented, the Pixies lead them astray by
lighting false fires. On other occasions they
are told off to help the villagers with their
housework, and their attentions are warmly
welcomed by the Devon folk. One good dame
was so pleased with the help a ragged little
Pixie who had torn her frock on a sweet-briar
bush gave her with her spinning, that she
made her a new set of clothes of bright green
cloth, and laid these by the spinning wheel.
The Pixy put them on at once, and singing</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Pixy fine, Pixy gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pixy now will run away!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>sped out of the house in broad daylight, and,
alas! she never came back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! ho!&rdquo; laughed a merry voice, and
a shock-headed little fellow swung himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
down from a bough just behind me, and turned
a somersault on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome, gay Puck!&rdquo; Titania cried.
&ldquo;Whence do you come, and what do you do
this night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I come from the court of King Oberon,
sweet Titania,&rdquo; answered the Elf, &ldquo;and to-night
I plait the manes and tails of Farmer
Best&rsquo;s grey horses. At early dawn I shall
skim the cream off the milk in his good wife&rsquo;s
dairy, since yester-e&rsquo;en she grudged a drink
of it to an orphan child. &lsquo;Robin Goodfellow
has been here!&rsquo; she will cry when she sees
what I have been after, and her greedy old
eyes will fill with tears. That is one of my
pet names, Wide-eyes,&rdquo; he added, hopping on
to my shoulder and pinching my ear. &ldquo;I am
also Pouke, Hobgoblin, and Robin Hood.
But where are the Urchins, my merry play-fellows?
It is high time that they were here,
for the lady moon has hung her lamp i&rsquo; the
sky.&rdquo;</p>

<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;The Fairy Ring was thronged with dancing Elves&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>The clouds were all tinted a deep rose pink,
and behind the trees, just where the moon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
risen, was a haze of purple. I knew by this
that it must be nearly tea-time, and I was just
going to say that I must go, when Titania left
the frond of bracken, and alighted in the centre
of the Fairy Ring. Waving her wand,
she summoned her &ldquo;gladsome sprites,&rdquo; and
next moment the Fairy Ring was thronged
with dancing Elves who wore red caps and
silver shoes, with bright green mantles buttoned
with bobs of silk. Puck flew to join them,
but Peas-blossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustard-seed,
who sprang from nowhere, danced in an
inner circle round the Fairy Queen. They
sang as they danced, and this is their song.
I found it afterwards in a book of Father&rsquo;s,
which he said had in it more wonderful
things than all books in the world but one:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;By the moon we sport and play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the night begins our day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we frisk the dew doth fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trip it, little urchins all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lightly as the little bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two by two and three by three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And about goe wee, goe wee.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&ldquo;And about goe wee, goe wee!&rdquo; echoed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the glade, and then the Elves suddenly disappeared,
with Puck and Titania and her
attendants.</p>

<p>The wood was growing darker every
minute, but the sparkles of frost were glittering
still, and lit my way. At the end of the
scrub I saw Father coming to meet me,
swinging down the road with such long steps
that he looked like a kindly big giant. He had
guessed where I had gone, and he was so
pleased to find me that he forgot to say I
mustn&rsquo;t explore any more without him, as I
was afraid he would. He took my hand, and
we both ran; it was lovely at home by the fire.</p>

<p>I meant to have told him about Queen
Titania while we were having tea, but Nancy
had made such scrumptious cakes that there
wasn&rsquo;t time at first, and before I had finished
he began to open the letters that had come
just after he left that morning. They seemed
to be all bills, and Father sighed as he looked
them over, his forehead puckered into rucks
and lines. Presently he came to a big blue
envelope, and he turned this round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
as if he thought there might be something
horrid inside. The paper crackled like anything
as he drew it out, and when it was
unfolded he sat looking at it for a long time,
though there didn&rsquo;t seem to be much writing.
At last he gave an odd kind of gasp, and took
my face between his hands. He pressed it
so hard that he made me say &ldquo;O!&rdquo; though I
didn&rsquo;t want to do this, and I wondered what
had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your great-aunt Helen is dead, Chris,&rdquo; he
said at last, as he let me go. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen
her for years and years.&hellip; She was not over
kind to me when I was a lad, though I believe
she meant well.&hellip; And now she&rsquo;s left us all
her money. We shan&rsquo;t be poor any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the beginning of ever so many
surprises. First, Father and I had warm new
overcoats, with woolly stuff inside them that
felt like blankets, only much more soft and
fluffy, and Nancy had the blue silk dress she
always vowed that she should buy when her
ship came home. There was a fire every night
in Father&rsquo;s study, and I had one in my bedroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
More patients came up for soup than
they did for medicine, and they said &ldquo;God bless
you, Sir!&rdquo; to Father so often that he wanted to
run away. The children in the hospital had the
biggest tree that the ward would hold, and all
the old men and women in the workhouse
had a big tea, and shawls and mufflers.</p>

<p>A few weeks later a strange young man
with a very shiny collar and a new brown
bag came to stay with us. Father said he
was a &ldquo;locum,&rdquo; but Nancy said it ought to be
&ldquo;locust,&rdquo; for his appetite was enormous, and she
couldn&rsquo;t make enough buttered toast to please
him. He had come to take care of Father&rsquo;s
patients until someone bought all the medicines
and things in the surgery, and I was
awfully glad to hear we were going away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go straight to the sunshine, Chris,&rdquo;
said Father, &ldquo;where there are trees and flowers
instead of long rows of houses, and the air
isn&rsquo;t full of smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that night I dreamt all about fairies,
and of what I was going to see and hear in
foreign lands.</p>

</div>

<p>The cliffs were hidden in the mist when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
we left Dover, and the sky was dull and grey.
But very soon it began to clear; a silvery
light shone behind the clouds, and then the
sun came out, and the rolling waves turned
emerald green. They tossed our steamer up
and down as if it were a cork, and Father
soon went below, but I begged so hard to be
allowed to stay on deck that he said I might
if I would promise, &ldquo;honour bright,&rdquo; not to
get into mischief.</p>

<p>When he had gone I put my cap into my
pocket, so that it might not blow off, and
leaned over the rails to watch the swell of the
sea. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of Fairies then, nor of
being a Christmas child, but of how it must
feel to be shipwrecked. So when the spray
blew in my face and made me blink, I was
surprised to see a merry red face grinning up
at me from the foam. It had curls of seaweed
upon its forehead, and a mouth like a big
round &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Father Neptune,&rdquo; it roared, so loudly
that I could hear it quite distinctly above the
noise of the wind. &ldquo;Why not take a header,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and come and ride one of my fine sea horses?
&lsquo;Father wouldn&rsquo;t like it?&rsquo; Ho! ho! ho! What
a molly-coddle of a boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A big wave tossed him on one side, and on
its crest was a beautiful girl with a shining
tail, and hair like a stream of gold. Of course
I knew she was a mermaid, and would want
me to go to her coral caves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come with me and play with
my sheeny pearls?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They gleam
like the dawn on a summer morning, and you
shall choose the loveliest for your very own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held out her arms and I nearly sprang
into them, for I thought that a pearl would be
splendid for Father&rsquo;s pin. But just behind
her I saw two ugly mermen, with horrid
green teeth and bright red eyes, and ropes of
seaweed in their long thin hands. Then I
remembered that mermaids were dangerous,
and I ran straight over to the other side of the
steamer and put my fingers into my ears,
so that I might not hear her call. She spoke
so sweetly that it was difficult to resist, but
I did not trust her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The water was calmer on this side, and I
wondered why until I saw some funny brown
men, rather like Brownies, but ever so much
bigger and stronger, stretched out at full
length on the tops of the waves. They were
blowing on conchs as hard as they could, and
wherever they blew, the waves grew quieter.
I guessed at once that they were Tritons&mdash;seafolk
who live with Neptune in his crystal
palace under the sea. I was still watching
them when Father came up behind me, and
told me that we were really in.</p>

<p>We stayed the night at a big hotel where
almost everyone spoke in a language which I
did not understand, and I had a grown-up
dinner with Father, with heaps of different
dishes, most of them tasting much alike.
Next day we went on for hours in the train,
and the air grew warmer and warmer, and the
grass more green, until at last we were in the
south of France. There were palms and orange
groves and heaps of flowers, and it would
have been just splendid if Father had been
all right. He hadn&rsquo;t had time to be ill at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
home you see, and now there were no sick
people to worry him, he was so tired that
he couldn&rsquo;t do anything. But he told me not
to worry, for once he was really rested, he
would soon get well.</p>

<p>And so he did, though it took a long time
to rest him, and we couldn&rsquo;t explore a bit.
In the mornings we strolled through the
gardens, or down to the sea, and most afternoons
we did nothing at all. Very often, as
I sat beside him on the verandah, with the
sun shining full on the green awning, and
the roses nodding to us over the balcony, he
would fall asleep; and then a Flower-Fairy
would peep through the ferns, and tell me the
loveliest stories. The Rose-Fairy came, and
the Queen of the Lilies, with a lovely gold
crown upon her head; but my favourite Fairy
lived in a bed of violets. Her frock was
purple, and I knew when she was coming
because the air all round grew sweet. Her
stories were the best of all. She had heard
them from the wind, she said, as he played
with her leaves at dawn. My favourite was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one that she said he had brought from
Provence.</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw016.jpg" width="375" height="368" alt="The Princess with the Sea-Green Hair." title="The Princess with the Sea-Green Hair." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;A worthy couple at Marseilles,&rdquo; she began,
&ldquo;had longed for a child for years in vain, and
great was their joy when they knew at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
that their wish was about to be granted. The
boy was born during a fearful storm, and the
first sound he heard was the crash of the sea
as it broke on the shore. He was christened
Paul, and grew up into a handsome lad with
a quantity of thick fair hair which curled
like the tips of the waves, and piercing blue
eyes which were always twinkling with
fun and mischief.</p>

<p>There was not any question as to what
calling he should follow, for the sea claimed
him as a son of her own, and he was never
content on dry land. When his ship came
home and the crew was dismissed, he could
not rest, and every evening at sunset he
would row himself out in a little boat as far
as he could go. One summer night, when a
thousand ripples danced on the waves, he
leaned over the side of his boat, gazing
down&mdash;down&mdash;down. He did not know why,
but he felt quite sure that someone was
calling him, and with all his heart he longed
to obey the summons. Presently he felt
himself lifted gently, and drawn through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
gleaming water by hands which he could not
see. It was black as night before they released
him, for neither sun nor moon pierce the
depths of the ocean. He would have been in
total darkness but for the strange-shaped fish
who carried lanterns on their heads, and
guided him to the gates of a palace, formed of
millions of barnacles. These were piled one
on the top of the other until they reached an
enormous height, and were decorated with
what looked like a row of human eyes.</p>

<p>The gates flew open as Paul approached
them, and through a passage of mother-of-pearl
he reached a chamber that flashed with
opal lights. Here a Fairy Princess awaited
him&mdash;a Princess so exquisitely beautiful in
spite of her sea-green hair, that though his
heart did not go out to her, he was not
repelled by the love she showed him.</p>

<p>She kept him with her for many hours, and
at dawn of day she bade him return to his
home, giving him two golden fish which he
was to show to all who asked him where he
had spent the night, telling them he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a&rsquo;fishing. The invisible hands which had
brought him thither bore him back to his boat,
and he landed just at sunrise. His golden fish
were a source of awe and wonder to his neighbours,
who had never seen their like before; but
the priest shook his head, and warned him to
have no dealings with the powers of darkness.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ibw017" id="ibw017"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p>But Paul could not resist rowing out to the
edge of the sunset. Evening after evening he
plied his oars, and always at twilight he was
drawn down&mdash;down, to the palace of the
strange Princess with the sea-green hair.
When he went on a voyage all was well with
him, for his vessel bore him to other seas,
where no one called him when the sky grew
red; but he was no sooner at home with his
parents than something within him made him
row out to the west.</p>

<p>At last it seemed as if he had forgotten the
Princess, for he fell in love with sweet Lucile,
who was as good and gentle as she was fair,
and willingly gave him her troth. Their
wedding was fixed for Easter Day, and the
night before, Paul wandered down to the sea-shore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thinking of the bliss in store for him on
the morrow. His love-lit eyes fell dreamily
on his boat, which had lain for months in the
shallow cove where he had moored her, and
without thinking what he was doing, he
stepped inside and took the oars in his hands.
Alas! No sooner did he feel the boat moving
under him, than he was seized by the old wild
longing to sail towards the west.</p>

<p>All happened as before, until he reached
the Princess&rsquo;s palace; but now, instead of
smiling sweetly, she received him with
threatening looks which showed an array of
cruel teeth behind her rose-red lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So! you have been unfaithful to me!&rsquo; she
cried. &lsquo;I will not slay you, since I have greater
punishments in store than death.&hellip; You shall
stay in the depths of the sea until your yellow
hair is bleached and white, and your face a
mask of hideous wrinkles. Then, and then
only, shall you return to land, and those who
have loved you best shall spurn you from them
as something loathsome. Scorn for scorn, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
pain for pain. Thus will I take my revenge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So for seven long years Paul was a
prisoner in the darkness of the deep, his bed
the black and slimy ooze, and his companions
fearsome monsters who would fain have
devoured him. At last, when his hair was
white as snow, and his face so wrinkled and
ugly that the children of the mer-folk shuddered
as they passed, he was seized by a
sprawling octopus, and dragged up through
the water. The loathsome creature held him
fast until they reached a spot not far from the
little brown cottage where Lucile had lived
with her old father, and here it loosened its
coils; and a great wave cast Paul on shore.
The cottage was empty and deserted, and the
winding path he had trodden so often was
covered with moss. Close by, however, was
another cottage, far more spacious, and
through the open door of this Paul saw his
old sweetheart sitting beside a cradle. She
sang as she rocked it gently with her foot,
and her shining needles flew in and out of a
fisherman&rsquo;s coarse blue sock.</p>

<p>As the shadow fell across the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
she looked up brightly, expecting to see her
husband. Meeting Paul&rsquo;s gaze instead, her
own grew strained with horror, and snatching
her baby from the cradle she fled to the inner
room. Without a word Paul hastened away.
He knew his doom, and hastened to throw
himself back to the sea.</p>

<p>In his headlong flight he stumbled against
an old, old woman, gathering drift-wood on the
wreck-strewn coast. She would have fallen
if he had not caught her in his arms, and as
he held her she saw his eyes. They alone
were unchanged, and his mother knew them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My boy&mdash;my dear boy!&rsquo; she cried with a
sob of joy. And she drew his seared face
down to her bosom, murmuring over it the
same fond words she had used when he was
a child. She kissed him, and the spell was
broken; once more he was good to look
upon.&hellip; The Princess had not known,
you see, that a mother&rsquo;s love is immortal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Father was still asleep when the story
came to an end, so I implored the Fairy to
tell me another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;This comes from Provence, too,&rdquo; she said
in answer to my pleading, &ldquo;and will show
you that sea-folk can sometimes be merciful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the crew of the good ship <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;Oiseau</cite>,
was a sailor named Antoine, who kept all on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
board alive with his merry wit. One day,
while sailing the waters of the Mediterranean,
the sea only faintly ruffled by the breeze that
helped them on their way, they espied what
at first appeared to be a huge sea-serpent
making its way towards them. For a few
moments the mariners watched it in much
alarm; then, to their immense relief, they
found that their &lsquo;sea-serpent&rsquo; was a string
of harmless porpoises, swimming in a row,
with their shining black backs just appearing
above the surface of the water. As they neared
the ship they broke their ranks, and evidently
regarding the sailors as their friends, gambolled
upon the waves like boisterous children.
No man dreamt of interfering with them until
Antoine thoughtlessly picked up a rusty spear
and threw it at one of those farthest away.
He did not do this from any desire to kill,
but only to show how excellent was his aim,
and when he saw his shaft strike home,
tinging the sea with red as his victim sank
with a convulsive shudder, he was seized
with self-reproach and a nameless dread.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>And behold! a great storm shook the
sea, as if the gods themselves were angry.
Thunder and lightning rolled and flashed,
and raindrops heavy as leaden balls fell in
swift torrents. So fearful was the tempest
that it threatened to overwhelm the ship, and
the Captain was in despair.</p>

<p>In this dire extremity a knight on a
magnificent black charger came riding over
the waves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Surrender him who threw the spear!&rsquo; he
cried, and the sea stayed its turmoil to listen.
&lsquo;Do this, and I will save the ship. Else
shall it perish, with all on board, and sea
creatures shall gnaw your bones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The sailors were exceedingly afraid, but
they would not betray their comrade. Seeing
this, Antoine stepped forth of his own accord,
for he would not let his shipmates suffer for
his fault. Leaping from the deck, he landed
upon the haunches of the charger, behind the
knight, and that moment the sea became
smooth as glass, and the strange steed
disappeared with his two riders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The ship made good way, and his shipmates
never expected to see poor Antoine again, but
to the amazement and joy of all, he rejoined
the vessel a few days later as though it had
stood by for him. The excitement of the men
was great as they gathered round him to hear
of his adventures.</p>

<p>And truly he had a marvellous story to
relate. He had ridden, he told them, to a
distant island, where in a castle of shimmering
gold, on a bed of the softest eiderdown, he
found a knight stretched in agony. It was he
whom he had wounded, while in the form of a
porpoise, and the spear he had thrown so
thoughtlessly was still sticking in his side.
He drew this out, with tears of shame, and
then, with his guilty right hand, he cleansed
and bathed the wound. When this was done,
the knight fell into a deep sleep, and woke at
dawn well as ever. Taking Antoine&rsquo;s hand,
he led him through many corridors lit with
gems to a resplendent banquet hall, where
the walls were encrusted with star-shaped
sapphires, and the floor was of beaten gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Many other knights were assembled here, and
maidens so fair that Antoine sighed to think
of them. When he had feasted on curious
dishes of rich fruits, the same knight who had
brought him thither took him back to the sea-shore,
where the same black horse awaited
their coming. Mounting as before, the charger
sped like the wind over the sea until the ship
hove in sight. When they came to within one
hundred yards of the vessel, the black steed
and his rider disappeared as mysteriously as
they had come, and Antoine was left struggling
in the water. However, he was an excellent
swimmer, and soon reached the ship&rsquo;s side, up
which he easily clambered by the aid of a rope
which fortunately happened to be trailing in
the water.</p>

<p>This was the tale that Antoine told his
shipmates, and in memory of the clemency
of the porpoise-knight, the sailors vowed
that never again would they injure a porpoise.
Not only were they as good as their word, but
the vow is kept to this day by their children&rsquo;s
children.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>It was spring time when we left for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Brittany. Father had been there once with
Mother, and thought he would like to go
again. So I said goodbye to my Flower-Fairy,
and promised that if I could I would come
back one day to see her.</p>

<p>The sunny air of the south had done
Father good, and now he was almost well.
While we were in the train he read from the
guide book, and told me about curious
&ldquo;dolmens,&rdquo; or mounds of stone, which are
supposed to have been built to mark the
ancients&rsquo; burying places. There were hundreds
of these in Brittany, he said, and I
was glad, for I knew they were haunted by
&ldquo;Gorics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Courils&rdquo;&mdash;strange Fairies of
olden times.</p>

<p>That very first evening, while Father was
writing letters, I slipped away by myself
instead of going to bed, for I wanted to see
a Poupican. A Poupican, you must know,
is the dwarf-child of a Korrigan&mdash;a Fairy who
looks lovely by night and horrible by day,
and cares for nothing so that she gets what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
she wants. Korrigans are said to have been
princesses in days gone by, but they were so
cruel and selfish that someone laid them
under a spell, which lasts for thousands of
years unless a mortal breaks it. On account
of the wicked things they said their mouths
are always dry, and they are consumed by
thirst; so they chose their homes by streams
and fountains, of which there are many in
Brittany.</p>

<p>Father had been telling me that there was
a famous fountain in a wood not far from our
hotel, and I thought I might find them here.
The fountain was hidden behind a grove of
fir-trees, but the moon shone down on its
rough grey stones, and turned the square
pond of water in front of it into a silver
mirror.</p>

<p>At first there seemed to be no one there,
but when my eyes had grown used to the
gloom I saw a number of Elves about two
feet in height, with misty white veils wound
round their bodies. A cloth was spread
beside the fountain. It was covered with
the loveliest things to eat&mdash;honey and fruit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and queer-shaped cakes sprinkled with sugar
comfits&mdash;while in the centre stood a crystal
goblet, from which the moon drew flashes of
soft fairy light. As I crouched in the ferns, a
wee green Wood-Elf stole up behind me; her
tiny face was good and kind, and although
she was so small that I could almost have
held her in my hand, I felt she was there to
protect me.</p>

<p>Then I turned my eyes to the crystal
goblet and I grew thirsty all at once; and I
wondered what the Korrigans would do if I
took a sip of the amber wine which filled it
to the brim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One drop would make you wise for
ever,&rdquo; whispered the Wood-Elf, just as if
I had spoken, &ldquo;but you would be silent
for ever, also. No mortal can drink that
wine and live. The Korrigans pass it round
to each other in a golden cup at the end
of their feast, which takes place but once
in the year. It gives them power to work
many charms, and to take the form of
animals at will.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw022.jpg" width="373" height="360"
alt="The Hunter who shot the white Doe." title="The Hunter who shot the white Doe." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Once, in these very woods, a hunter shot
a fair white doe, when to his amazement, she
spoke to him in a human voice. He was so
touched by her reproaches that he tore his
fine linen shirt into strips to bind up her
wound, and then hurried off to the spring for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
water to quench her thirst. It was dusk by
the time he could get back to her, for the first
spring he reached was dry, and instead of
the milk-white doe, he found a beauteous
maiden, who threw herself on his bosom and
entreated him not to leave her. For a year
and a day he was under her spells, but he
escaped in the end by making the sign of the
cross with his two forefingers. This sign puts
a Korrigan to instant flight, for things which
are holy fill them with terror.&hellip; Ah! they
have been at their mischief again. Poor
Annette will weep for this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wood-Elf stopped speaking, for running
lightly over the grass, holding each other&rsquo;s
long white veils so as to form a swinging
cradle, came a group of nine smooth-limbed
Korrigans, their red-gold hair tossing on the
wind behind them. In the midst of the
hanging cradle lay a tiny baby, with widely
opened eyes and a solemn pink face, sucking
a fat round thumb.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have stolen him from his mother,
while she dreamt of fairy gold,&rdquo; the Wood-Elf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sighed. &ldquo;She should not have left
her door on the latch; it was a sad mistake.
In her little one&rsquo;s place there is now a
Poupican. At first she will not know, but
will fondle and kiss the changeling as if he
were her own. After a while she will
grieve to find that he gives her no love in
return for hers, and plays as readily with
strangers as with his mother. But her husband,
who is a hard man, will rejoice at the
wee child&rsquo;s cleverness. For he will have an
old head on young shoulders, and be wise
beyond his years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Wood-Elf was speaking, poor
Annette&rsquo;s baby lay contentedly beside the
crystal goblet, sucking his thumb and looking
up at the stars. The Korrigans had left off
singing now, and they were passing round
the golden cup when there came on the
wind the sound of a church bell. Flinging the
cup and the goblet into the pond, and staying
only to wind the baby in their clinging veils, the
Korrigans fled into the darkness with cries of
anguish. Some spell seemed to hold me, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
I should have tried to rescue the little thing;
for it was dreadful to think what might happen
to him with the Korrigans.</p>

<p>But the Wood-Elf was quite comforting.
&ldquo;He will be well taken care of,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
someday Annette may break the spell, with
the help of the Curé. Rose-Marie got back
her child by her own wit, but then she has
the name of the blessed Mother. &lsquo;You would
like to know how?&rsquo; Then I must speak
softly, lest a Korrigan should hear.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw023.jpg" width="267" height="170" alt="The baby" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw024.jpg" width="373" height="367" alt="Rose Marie and the Poupican." title="Rose Marie and the Poupican." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Rose-Marie was very young when she
married Pierre,&rdquo; began the Elf, &ldquo;and nothing
his mother or hers could say would induce
her to beware of Korrigans when her baby
came.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;They would not hurt him even if they
could,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Who could harm anything
so small and sweet?&rsquo; And she
actually set his cradle under the cherry trees,
so that his round pink face was covered with
fallen petals. Then she went to fetch Pierre
from his sowing that he might see how his
little son was hidden under the spring snow,
and lingered on her way to gather a cluster of
purple violets.</p>

<p>When she had disappeared, the Korrigans
stole her baby, leaving a Poupican in the
fragrant nest. The sun had gone in when she
came back, and the little creature was wailing
fretfully, Rose-Marie snatched him to her
bosom and tried to soothe him, but from that
day forward she had no rest. Her milk was
sweet and plentiful, and the cradle was soft
and warm, but he gave neither her nor her
good man Pierre a moment&rsquo;s peace. All
through the hours of the night he wailed,
and tore at her hair when she held him
close to her, scratching her face like an angry
kitten.</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="ic002" id="ic002"></a>
<img src="images/ic002.jpg" width="369" height="483" alt="Rose-Marie and the Poupican" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">Rose-Marie and the Poupican</span>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>When he grew older, he was just as bad,
for there was no end to his mischief. He
shut the cat in a bin of flour, and opened the
oven door when Rose-Marie was baking, so
that the bread was spoilt. He drove the hens
into the brook, and cut the cord which
tethered Pierre&rsquo;s white cow, so that she
roamed for miles. And with all he did, he
never uttered a word. It was this which first
roused Rose-Marie&rsquo;s suspicions, and after that
she watched him carefully.</p>

<p>One morning she made up her mind to surprise
him into speaking, and as he sat beside
the hearth, peering at her through his half-closed
eyes, she set an egg shell on the fire, and
placing in this a spoonful of broth, stirred it
carefully with a silver pin. The Poupican
was amazed, for it was nearing the dinner
hour, and there would be ten to feed. At last
he could contain himself no longer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What are you doing, Mother?&rsquo; he asked
in a strange cracked voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am preparing a meal for ten,&rsquo; returned
Rose-Marie, without looking round.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;For ten&mdash;in an eggshell?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;I
have seen an egg before a hen; I have seen
the acorn before the oak; but never yet saw I
folly such as this!&rsquo; And he fell to cackling
like a full farmyard, rocking himself from
side to side, and repeating, &lsquo;Such folly I never
saw!&rsquo; until even gentle Rose-Marie was
moved to anger.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have seen too much, my son,&rsquo; she
said, and lifting him up by the scruff of his
neck in spite of his struggles, she carried him
out of the house. Then, sitting down on a heap
of stones beside the brook, she proceeded to
whip him soundly. At his first cry of pain
a Korrigan appeared, in the shape of an ugly
old woman with bleared red eyes and straggling
tresses. She was leading a curly-haired
boy by the hand, the living image of Pierre.
As she released him he flew across the grass
to Rose-Marie and hid his face in her skirts.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here is thy son!&rsquo; croaked the Korrigan.
&lsquo;I have fed him on meal and honey, and he
has learnt no evil. Give me my Poupican,
and I will go.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>So Rose-Marie gave up the Poupican, and
with a thankful heart took her own son home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know any more stories?&rdquo; I asked
when the Elf stopped for breath. I didn&rsquo;t
want to go back just yet, for it was jolly
in the wood, and I could smell violets close by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than I can tell,&rdquo; replied the Elf,
&ldquo;but you shall hear what happened to Peric
and Jean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a beautiful valley not far from here
a number of Korrigans were accustomed to
gather on summer nights, for the grass was
soft as velvet, and the mountains sheltered
it from the breeze. None of the peasants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
dare cross the valley after dark, lest they
might be forced to join their revels; for it was
known by all that the Korrigans must dance
whether they would or not, until some mortal
should break the charm that had been laid
upon them.</p>

<p>One evening, when the west was aglow with
fire, a farmer was sent for to attend the
sick bed of his mother, who lived on the other
side of the valley. His wife and he had been
at work all day in the fields, since labour was
scarce and they were poor, and as both loved
the old woman dearly, they hurried off
without stopping to lay aside their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourches</i>&mdash;little
sticks which are still used in some parts
of Brittany as &lsquo;plough paddles.&rsquo; By the time
they were half-way across the valley, the
dusk had fallen, and they found themselves
encircled by angry Korrigans, who shrieked
with rage and made as if they would tear
them to pieces. Before they had touched
them, however, they all fell back, and a moment
later broke into singing. This was their
song:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Lez y, Lez hon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(<cite>Let him go, let him go</cite>,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bas an arer zo gant hook;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Bas an arer zo gant y!&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(<cite>For she has the wand of the plough!</cite>)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then the dancers made way for the farmer
and his wife, who reached the old mother
safely, and comforted her last hours.</p>

<p>When they returned to their own homes
they told what they had seen and heard.
Some of the villagers were still too much
afraid of the Korrigans to venture, but others
armed themselves with <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourches</i>, and hastened
to the valley when night had fallen. All of
these witnessed the famous dance, but none
felt inclined to join it.</p>

<p>In a neighbouring village two tailors
dwelt, and they were as anxious as the rest
to see the Korrigans. The elder was a tall
and handsome fellow named Jean, but in
spite of his inches he had no pluck, and was
idle as well as vain. The other was Peric,
a red-haired hunchback, so kind and lovable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in spite of his looks that if ever a neighbour
were in trouble, it was to Peric he went first.
Though the hunchback and Jean shared the
same business, the latter was always gibing
at Peric, and left him to do most of the
work.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Since you&rsquo;re so courageous,&rsquo; he sneered,
one fine warm night when he and Peric had
stayed behind in the valley to watch the
Korrigans, &lsquo;suppose you ask them to let you
join their dance. Your hump should make
you safe with them, for they are not likely to
fall in love with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Peric cheerfully, though
at this unkind reference to his deformity his
face had flushed. And taking off his cap he
approached the whirling Elves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I dance with you?&rsquo; he asked
politely, dropping his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fourche</i> to show he
trusted them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re more brave than good looking,&rsquo;
they replied, their feet still moving to the
same quick measure. &lsquo;Are you not afraid
that we shall work you ill?&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Not a bit!&rsquo; answered Peric, joining hands
with them; and he started to sing as lustily
as they:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Dilun, Dimeurs, Dimerc&rsquo;her</i>,&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>which means &lsquo;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.&rsquo;
After a while he grew tired of singing
these three words so often, and went on of
his own accord:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ha Diriaou, ha Digwener</i>,&rsquo;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(And Thursday and Friday!)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Mat! Mat!</i>&rsquo; (Good! Good!) cried the Korrigans
in chorus, and though he could not tell
why they were so delighted, he was glad to have
given them pleasure. When they offered him
the choice of wealth or power in return for some
mysterious service which he seemed to have
rendered them, he only laughed, for he
thought that they were poking fun at him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take away my hump, then,&rsquo; he cried at
last, &lsquo;and make me as handsome as my
friend Jean. A little maid whom I love
dearly will not look at me when he is near,
though she likes well enough to talk to me by
the fountain if he is out of the way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; exclaimed the Korrigans.
&lsquo;That will not give us the slightest trouble!&rsquo;
and catching him in their veils, they tossed
him three times in the air. The third time
he alighted on his feet. He was now as tall
and straight as he could wish to be, with fine
soft hair as black as the raven&rsquo;s wing.</p>

<p>Instead of rejoicing at his friend&rsquo;s good
fortune, Jean was full of envy. Forgetting
his fears in his greed for gain, he pushed
himself into the midst of the Korrigans, who
had once more begun to dance, and joined
them in their singing. His voice was less
melodious than Peric&rsquo;s, and he did not keep
time so well, but they suffered him amongst
them out of curiosity.</p>

<p>Presently he, like Peric, grew tired of the
monotonous chant, and shouted:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Ha Disadarn, ha Disul&rsquo;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2">(And Saturday and Sunday)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&lsquo;What else? what else?&rsquo; cried the Korrigans
in great excitement, but he only looked
as stupid as an owl, and repeated these words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>over and over. Catching him in their veils,
they tossed him up as they had done Peric,
and when he came down again he found he
had red hair and a hump. They were angry

<p>There were so many things in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Brittany that Father wanted to show me&mdash;places
he had seen with Mother, and curious
monuments, and lovely views,&mdash;that I could
not get out alone again until the day before
we went on to Normandy. No Fairy would
ever speak to me unless I was quite by myself,
and the quaint little men who peered out from
the old ruins when I ran on in front, scampered
away at once when Father came in sight.</p>

<p>On that last morning a funny old postman
in a blue cap brought him some letters from
home. They were about the practice, and
Father said that he must stay indoors to
answer them. The patients did not seem to
like the &ldquo;locust&rdquo; at all, according to Nancy.
I don&rsquo;t suppose he gave them such nice-tasting
medicines as Father did.</p>

<p>The moment he took up his pen I was
off to the wood. The paths were carpeted
with velvet moss, and starry flowers peeped
through the green. Some bees were buzzing
round a clump of violets that grew by the
side of the fountain, and sitting on the steps
were two hideous old women, with bleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
red eyes and wisps of faded hair. As I drew
near they scowled most horribly, and vanished
in the spray. I was delighted to find my
Wood-Elf by the violets, for somehow the sight
of those two old crones had made me shiver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were Korrigans!&rdquo; the Wood-Elf
whispered. &ldquo;That is how they look by
daylight, so it is no wonder that they hate to
be seen by mortals! I shouldn&rsquo;t advise you
to come here to-night, for they will bear you
a grudge, and might tempt you to dance with
them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought of what had befallen Jean, and
shook my head. It must be dreadful to have
a hump, though I read of one once that turned
into wings. But Jean&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t seem that kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know better than to put myself in their
power,&rdquo; I cried, and the Wood-Elf laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think you are very wise,&rdquo; she said,
pausing the next moment to coax a bee to
give her a sip of honey, &ldquo;but mortal men are
not a match for Fairy Folk. The Dwarfs, or
Courils, who haunt the stone tables and
curious mounds you find throughout this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
country, compel all travellers by night who
come their way to dance with them, whether
they will or no. They don&rsquo;t let them stop
dancing until they drop to the ground, worn
out with fatigue, and sometimes the poor
creatures never regain their strength. Mère
Gautier&rsquo;s husband danced with the Dwarfs
when he was but eight-and-twenty, and he
has not done a stroke of work from that day
to this, though now he is eighty-five. Mère
Gautier keeps the home together, and he sits
by the fireside and tells the neighbours how
the Dwarfs looked and what they said. The
Curé declares that such idleness is sinful, and
that he might work if he would; but one
cannot be sure, and he makes himself out to
be a very poor creature.</p>

<p>The Gorics&mdash;tiny men but three feet high,
though they have the strength of giants&mdash;are
little better than Courils. Near Quiberon, by
the sea shore, is a heap of huge stones, some
say no less than four thousand in number,
known as &lsquo;The House of the Gorics,&rsquo; and
every night the Dwarfs come out and dance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
round it till break of day. If they spy a
belated traveller, even in the distance, they
compel him to join them, just as the Courils
do; and when he faints from sheer exhaustion
they vanish in peals of laughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Fairy I met in the South spoke of
little men who gave away fairy gold,&rdquo; I said,
trying not to let my voice sound sleepy. The
sun was hot, though it was early spring, and
there was a grasshopper just at my elbow
who had been chirping a lullaby to her babies
for the last half-hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you shut your eyes you will see
nothing!&rdquo; the Wood-Elf pouted; and I knew
that she had noticed my yawn. I sat up then,
and told her how pretty I thought her frock,
all brown and green, with a dainty girdle of
silver. She laughed at this, and I coaxed her
to tell me another story. It was one, she said,
that had been sung in verse on the Welsh
hills, for in ancient times the people of Wales
and those of &ldquo;Little Britain&rdquo; were the closest
friends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw031.jpg" width="370" height="359"
alt="The Wee Men of Morlaix" title="The Wee Men of Morlaix" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Long, long ago,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;a lordly
castle was built at Morlaix, in the midst of
such pleasant surroundings that some little
Dwarfs in search of a home thought that they
could not do better than build their stronghold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>underneath it. So they set to work
immediately, for they have a very wise
rule that when once they decide that a thing
must be done, it shall be done at once. By
the time that the castle was finished, their
home was completed too. Far below the
ground they had fashioned a number of oval
chambers, with ceilings encrusted with gleaming
pearls which they found in the bay, and
floors paved with precious amber. Beyond
these chambers lay their treasure house,
where they kept rich stores of fairy gold, and
the winding passages which led to the upper
world were only just wide enough to allow
them to creep through. Their entrances were
cunningly contrived to look like rabbit holes,
so that strangers might think they led to
nothing more than some sandy warren.</p>

<p>But the country folk knew better, for they
often watched the little men run in and out,
beating a faint tattoo on the silver basins in
which they collected the morning dew and the
evening mist, which served them for food and
drink. Now and then, when the sky was a
vault of blue, and the sun shone his brightest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they brought up piles of their golden coins,
that they might see them glisten in the light
of day. So friendly were they to mortals, that
if they were surprised while thus employed,
they seldom failed to share their wealth.</p>

<p>One very bleak autumn there was much
distress on the countryside, for the harvest
had failed for the third season, and many of
the smaller farmers were on the verge of
ruin. Jacques Bosquet&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Jacques</i>&mdash;his
neighbours called him, for he had never
refused his help to a friend in need&mdash;was one
of these. His frail old mother was weak and
ailing, and he did not know how to tell her
that she must leave the homestead to which
she had come as a bride, full fifty years before.
In his despair he tried to borrow a thousand
francs from a rich merchant in the next
town; but the merchant was a hard man, and
his mouth closed like a cruel steel trap when
he told Jacques roughly that he had no money
to lend. As Jacques returned home his eyes
were so dim with the tears which pride forbade
him to shed, that in passing the castle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Morlaix he all but fell over three little men,
who were counting out gold by a deep hole.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is wrong with you, friend, that you
do not see where you are going?&rsquo; cried the
eldest of the three; and when Jacques told
them of his fruitless errand, they at once
invited him to help himself to their treasure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take all you can hold in your hand!&rsquo;
they urged, and since Jacques&rsquo; hand had been
much broadened with honest toil, this meant
a goodly sum. The three little men had
vanished before Jacques found words to
express his gratitude, and he hurried away
with a thankful heart. The coins were of
solid gold, and stamped with curious signs; to
his great joy he very soon sold them for a big
price, and had now sufficient not only to pay his
debts, but to carry him through the winter.</p>

<p>When the merchant who had received his
appeal so churlishly heard of his good fortune,
he was full of envy, and determined to lay
in wait for the little men himself. Though
blessed with ample means, he coveted more,
and when at last he surprised the Dwarfs as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Jacques had done, he made so piteous a tale
that they generously allowed him to take two
handfuls instead of one. But this did not
content the greedy fellow, and pushing the
wee men rudely away, he stooped to fill his
pockets from the heap. As he did so, a
shower of blows rained fiercely round his head
and face, and so heavily did they fall that he
had much ado to save his skull. When at
last the blows ceased, and he dared to open
his eyes, the Dwarfs had gone, with all their
gold, and his pockets were empty of even that
which they had contained before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Wood Elf paused, for a large brown
bird had perched himself on a branch which
overhung the fountain. She waited until he
had dipped his beak in the sparkling stream
and flown away before she spoke again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bird is a stranger to these woods,&rdquo;
she said presently under her breath, &ldquo;and I
wondered if it were really an Elf or a Fée.
One never knows in these parts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me!&rdquo; I urged; for I knew by her look
that she was thinking of another story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw032.jpg" width="359" height="345"
alt="The Bird at the Window." title="The Bird at the Window." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;There was once a most beautiful lady,&rdquo;
she began, &ldquo;whose face was so kind and
gentle that wherever she went the children
flocked round her and hung on her gown.
No flower in the garden could hold up its
head beside her, for the roses themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were not so sweet, and even the lilies drooped
before her exceeding fairness.</p>

<p>From far and near lovers came to woo her,
but she would none of them; for ever in her
mind was a gallant knight to whom she had
plighted her troth in the land of dreams. In
the presence of a holy man, whose features
were those of the Curé who confirmed her, he
had placed a ring upon her finger; and so real
did this dream seem, that she held herself to
to be the knight&rsquo;s true wife. Her songs were
all of him as she sat at her spinning, and her
tender thoughts made warp and weft with the
shining threads. When she went to the
fountain, she heard his voice in the splash
of the falling water, and when the stars shone
through her casement, she fancied that they
were the adoring eyes of her beloved. She
prayed each night that she might be patient
and faithful until he claimed her, for he, and
none other, should touch her lips.</p>

<p>But she was very beautiful, and her parents
were very poor. And when the lord of those
parts saw and desired her, they gave her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
him, despite her prayers, though he was bent
and old. He carried her off to his grim
castle, and that no man but he should gaze on
her loveliness, he shut her in his tower, with
only an aged widow as her attendant. The
widow was half-blind and wholly deaf, and
withal so crabbed in disposition that as she
passed the very dogs in the street slunk off to a
safe distance. In vain the beautiful lady
pleaded to be allowed to stroll in the gardens, or
to ply her needle on the balcony; he would not
let her stir from her gloomy chamber, and for
seven long years he kept her in durance. His
love had by this time turned to hate, for her
beauty was dimmed with weeping. No longer
did her hair make a mesh of gold for sunbeams
to dance in, and her face was like a sad white
pearl from which all tints had fled. And the
heart of the wicked lord rejoiced, for since he
could not win her favour, and she no longer
delighted his eyes, he was glad that she
should die.</p>

<p>One morning in May when the dew lay
thick upon the meadows and every thrush had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
found a mate, the old lord went off for a long
day&rsquo;s hunting, and the aged widow fell fast
asleep. The beautiful lady sighed anew as
the sweet spring sunshine flooded her prison,
seeming to mock her with its splendour.
&lsquo;Ah, woe is me!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I may not even
rejoice in the sun as the meanest of God&rsquo;s
creatures!&rsquo; And in her great despair she
called aloud to her own true knight, bidding
him deliver her from her misery. Even as
she spoke, a shadow fell across the window.
A bird had stayed his flight beside it; he
pressed through the bars and was at her feet.
His ash-brown plumage and rounded wings
told her he was a goshawk, and from the
jesses on his legs she saw he had been
a&rsquo;hunting. While she gazed in surprise at
his sudden appearance, she beheld a transformation,
and in less time than it takes to
tell, the goshawk had become a gallant knight,
with raven locks and flashing eyes. It was
the knight of her dreams, and with a cry of
joy she flew to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I could not come to thee before, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Sweet,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;since thou didst not call for
me aloud. Now shall I be with thee at thy
lightest wish, and no more shalt thou be lonely.
But beware of the aged crone who guards thy
door! Her purblind eyes are not beyond
seeing, and should she discover me I must die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And now the beautiful lady no longer
pined to leave her prison, for she had only to
breathe his name, and her lover reappeared.
Her beauty came back to her as gladness to
the earth when the sun shines after rain, and
her songs were as joyous as those of the lark
when it soars high in the heavens. The old
lord was greatly puzzled, and bade the ancient
widow keep a careful watch.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My beautiful lady is gay!&rsquo; he said, with
an ugly smile. &lsquo;We must learn why she
and sighs are strangers. I had thought ere
this to lay her to sleep beneath a smooth
green coverlet, and it does not please me to
see her thus content.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The aged crone bathed her eyes in water
that flowed from a sacred shrine, so that sight
might come back to them, and hid herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
behind a curtain when the beautiful lady
thought that she had left the tower. From
this place of vantage she beheld, shortly after,
the arrival of the goshawk, and his transformation
into a handsome and tender knight.
Slipping away unseen, she hastened to her
master and told him all, not forgetting to
describe the beautiful lady&rsquo;s rapture in her
knight&rsquo;s embrace.</p>

<p>The jealous lord was furious with rage, and
caused, at dead of night, four sharp steel
spikes to be fixed to the bars of the window
in the tower. On leaving his love, the goshawk
flew past these safely, but when he
returned at dusk the next evening, he overlooked
them in his eagerness, and was sorely
hurt. The beautiful lady hung over her
beloved, distraught with grief; all bleeding
from his wounds, he sought to comfort her.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw034.jpg" width="384" height="504" alt="The jealous lord" title="" />
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Dear love, I must die!&rsquo; he murmured
faintly, &lsquo;but thou shalt shortly bear me a son
who will dispel thy sorrows and avenge my
fate.&rsquo; Then he gave her a ring from his
finger, telling her that while she wore it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>neither the old lord nor the widow would
remember aught that she would have them
forget. He also gave her his jewelled sword,
and bade her keep it till the day when Fate
should bring her to his tomb, and she should
&lsquo;learn the story of the dead.&rsquo; Then, and then
only, he commanded, was his son to know
what had befallen him.</p>

<p>The beautiful lady wept anew, and in a
passion of grief begged him not to leave her;
but once more bidding her a fond farewell, he
resumed the form of a goshawk, and flew
mournfully away.</p>

<p>It happened as the knight foretold. Neither
the widow nor the old lord remembered his
coming, and when the beautiful lady&rsquo;s son was
born, the old lord was proud and happy. His
satisfaction made him somewhat less cruel to
the beautiful lady, who lived but for her boy.
In cherishing him her grief grew less, but
though she had now her freedom, she never
ceased to long for the time when her son
should know the truth about his father.</p>

<p>The boy grew into a lad, and the lad into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a handsome and gallant knight. He was high
in favour at court, since none could approach
him in chivalry or swordmanship, and many
marvelled that one so brave and pure as he
could be the son of the old lord, whose advancing
years were as evil as those of his youth
had been. One day his mother and he were
summoned by the King to a great festival,
and rather than let them out of his sight, the
old lord rose from his bed to go with them.
They halted on their way at a rich Abbey,
where the Abbot feasted them royally and
before they left desired to show them some of
the Abbey&rsquo;s splendours. When they had
duly admired the exquisite carvings in the
chapels, and the golden chalice on the High
Altar, he conducted them to a chapter room,
where, covered with hangings of finely
wrought tapestry, and gorgeous embroideries
of blue and silver, was a stately tomb.
Tapers in golden vessels burned at its head
and feet, and the clouds of incense that filled
the air floated from amethyst vessels. It was
the tomb, the Abbot said, of &lsquo;a noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
most valiant knight,&rsquo; who had met his death
for love&rsquo;s sweet sake, slain by certain mysterious
wounds which he bore on his stricken
breast.</p>

<p>When the beautiful lady heard this, she
knew she had found the resting place of her
own true love, and taking his sword from the
silken folds of her gown, where she had ever
carried it concealed from view, she handed it
to the young knight and told him all.</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;Fair son, you now have heard,&rsquo; she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;That God hath us to this place led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is your father who here doth lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom this old man slew wrongfully.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>With this she fell dead at her son&rsquo;s feet;
and forthwith he drew the sword from its
jewelled scabbard, and with one swift blow
smote off the old lord&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Thus did he avenge the wrongs of his
parents, whom he vowed to keep in his
remembrance while life should last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fruit trees were a-glow with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
blossom when we reached Normandy, and
the pink and white Elves who played hide-and-seek
in the boughs were as lovely as Titania.
We spent some time at a big farm, where
Father had stayed long ago with Mother,
and we drove all over the country in the
farmer&rsquo;s gig.</p>

<p>One day I woke quite early, when the birds
had only just commenced to twitter, and the
sky was still rosy with dawn. I threw open
my little casement window as wide as it
would go, and the air smelt so sweet, and it
was all so beautiful, that I longed to be out-of-doors.
In the quiet of the early morning
the Elves might be abroad, so I slipped on my
things and stole down to the orchard. And
there, sure enough, were the Elfin hosts.</p>

<p>But though I told them who I was, they
were too shy to talk, and scattered the
blossom on my upturned face, when I tried
to coax them. A fat brown thrush scolded me
for disturbing her babies at their breakfast,
and fluttered round me, beating her wings,
until I moved away, when the Elves seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to be as pleased as she was, for they wanted
to be left to themselves.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the orchard was a
bank of moss, and I strolled across and sat
down in a little hollow. The moss was soft as
velvet, and through the boughs of a pear tree,
laden with bloom, I could see the gate to the
farm-yard. A speckled hen was the only
creature in sight, and it amused me to watch
how daintily she pecked this side and that.
All at once there came an excited chorus of
&ldquo;<em>Cluck-Cluck-Cluck!&rdquo;</em> and it seemed as if
every fowl in the place were trying to go
through the gate. They were led by a fine
young cock, with beautifully bright green head
feathers. Once he was safely through, he
perched himself on an empty pail, and crowed
indignantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cock-adoodle-do-oo!&rdquo;</em> mocked a voice
behind him, and a little boy in a red cap
gave him a box on the ears which sent him
flying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That bird thinks twice too much of himself,&rdquo;
he grinned, as he ran to me over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
grass. &ldquo;Who am I? Why, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i> of
Normandy, first cousin to Puck and Robin
Goodfellow across the water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had twinkling eyes that were never
still, and a roguish face. I knew I was going
to like him immensely, so I showed him my
new knife and said he might whittle his stick
if he&rsquo;d promise to give it back to me. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain
Rouge</i> felt both blades with a small brown
finger, and said they were too blunt for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blunt?&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Why, they&rsquo;re as sharp
as sharp can be! Just see!&rdquo; But when I
tried to show him how sharp they were,
neither would cut at all. I was so surprised
that I hadn&rsquo;t a word to say, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i>
doubled himself in two with laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he gasped, when he could
speak, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make them all right for you.&rdquo;
He touched them again, twisting his tongue
round the corner of his mouth, and screwing
his eyes up comically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now cut!&rdquo; he said, and when I found they
were as sharp as ever, I shut up the blades,
and put the knife back into my pocket. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
glad I had left my watch in the house, for
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i> might have tried to play tricks
with that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another name I go by is the &lsquo;Lutin,&rsquo;&rdquo; he
said, throwing himself on the ground beside
me. &ldquo;When I have nothing better to do, I
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lutine</i>, or twist, the horses&rsquo; manes. One
summer afternoon two lazy maids fell fast
asleep in the hay loft, when they ought to
have been down with the reapers in the long
field. I <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lutined</i> their hair so nicely for them
that when they woke they could not untwist
it, and had to cut it off! The House Spirits
made rather a fuss, for those girls were pets
of theirs, but Abundia, Queen of the Fées and
Lutins, said I had done quite right. We
can&rsquo;t bear laziness, you know, for we&rsquo;re always
busy ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you do besides mischief?&rdquo; I
said slyly, as he smoothed the feather in his
pretty cap. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i> looked quite offended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the truth were told,&rdquo; he said in a huff,
&ldquo;I should fancy I&rsquo;m twice as much use as you
are. The farmers couldn&rsquo;t get on without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
me. I look after the horses, and help to rub
the poor beasts down when they come home
tired at the end of the day; I stir their food
so that it agrees with them, and scare off the
grey goblins who might put it into their heads
to work no more at the plough. And I&rsquo;m as
good to the farmers&rsquo; wives as an extra maid,
even if I do take my pay in a drink of cream.
I dance my shadow on the wall to amuse the
children if they are fretful, and tell them
stories when the wind moans down the
chimney and would frighten them if it could.
And I pinch their toes when they are naughty,
and hide the playthings they leave about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked so much in earnest while he told
me all this, and so very good, that I was
beginning to think he was not half so mischievous
as Puck, when he gave a funny little
chuckle, and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such fun as I have with the fishermen!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;If they forget to cross themselves
with holy water before they go to sea, I fill
their nets with heavy stones, or entice away
the fish. When the fancy takes me, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
change myself into the form of a handsome
young man, and if folks do not then treat
me with proper respect, and call me &lsquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon
Garçon</i>&rsquo; civilly, I pelt them with stones until
they run! Their wives and daughters are
always gentle to poor <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i>, however;
and when I can, I do them a good turn.
Shall I tell you how I consoled the fair Marguerite
when she wept? Then listen well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A favourite haunt of mine,&rdquo; began <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain
Rouge</i>, &ldquo;is a little fishing village, close to
Dieppe. The maidens there are more to my
mind than those on any other part of the coast;
their skin is like clear pale amber, warmed
into redness where the sun has kissed it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
their eyes&mdash;ah! you should see them! The
fairest of all was Marguerite, and often I sat
for hours on her window-sill to watch her at
her spinning. Etienne would come and watch
her too, and he thought, foolish lad, that her
angel-face meant an angel temper; but I knew
she had a tongue.</p>

<p>And such a tongue! It was like the brook,
for it never stopped, and she said such sharp
and bitter things that the love of her friends
withered up as they heard them, just as
spring lilies droop before a cruel East wind.
Etienne was a stranger, or he would have
known better than to woo her seriously.
Strange to relate, the wayward maid was
different from the day he came. I had never
known her so soft and sweet, and the neighbours
said that surely some good fairy had
laid her under a spell.</p>

<p>Etienne and she were wed one summer
morning, but the little new moon had not
shone in the heavens a second time when
there was trouble between them. Marguerite&rsquo;s
tongue was sharper than ever from its long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
rest, and Etienne could not believe it belonged
to his &lsquo;angel&rsquo; bride. He left the cottage
without a word, and when he came back his
mouth was grim, for his mates had hastened to
make things worse by telling him many tales.
A foolish man was Etienne, or he would not
have heeded them; but that is neither here
nor there.</p>

<p>From this time on he made as though he
were deaf when Marguerite railed at him, and
he took her no more to his breast when he
came back from the sea. And Marguerite
grieved, for she loved him well in her woman&rsquo;s
way, and longed for his caresses. The sight
of his pale set face, and his sombre eyes&mdash;they
were like the eyes of a dog in pain, when
the hand he loves best has struck him&mdash;stung
her to fresh taunts, and there came a day
when he answered her back in the same way,
and all but struck her. Ah! a woman&rsquo;s tongue
can do rare mischief! His mother had never
heard an ugly word from him.</p>

<p>One eve I met Marguerite on the shore.
She was sobbing bitterly, for she had just
come out of a cave in the rocks, where dwelt
a Witch who could read the future.</p>

<p>I had taken the form of a slim, dark, serious
looking lad, and laying a gentle hand upon
her arm, &lsquo;What ails you, Madame Marguerite?&rsquo;
I said. She glanced at me piteously, as one
who seeks a refuge and knows not where to
turn, and wrung her hands.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I have lost my Etienne&rsquo;s heart for ever,
for ever,&rsquo; she wailed, &lsquo;unless I can find the
White Stone of Happiness, which a mermaid
throws from the depths of the sea once in a
thousand years. I may search for months,
and never find it; and Etienne holds aloof
from me, and grows further away each day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now just at her feet lay a small white stone,
smooth and round as a Fairy&rsquo;s plaything. I
picked it up and showed it to her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It shall be yours,&rsquo; I told her gravely, &lsquo;if
you give me your solemn promise to heed my
words.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I promise!&rsquo; she answered fervently, and
the wind tossed her unbound hair until it
floated round her shoulders like a Kelpie&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
mane. A seventh wave rushed up to her feet,
and as she moved nearer the breakwater, I
sang her this little song:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;Fairy stone of fairy spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marguerite, O guard it well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thine anger doth arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elves would rob thee of thy prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Press it &rsquo;neath thy tongue so red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold it firm till wrath has sped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smile, speak softly, and behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love shall warm thee as of old.&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then I gave her the stone, and she clasped it
against her bosom and sped to her home.</p>

<p>When Etienne returned he was in a bitter
mood. Luck had been against him; he had
caught no fish, and his largest net had been
torn on the rocks. Marguerite set a meal
before him, but he pushed it angrily away;
for the broth had burned while she was with
the Witch, and tasted anything but pleasant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Such food is not fit for a dog!&rsquo; he cried.
&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas an ill day for me when I came to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Pollet!</i> I had done better to drown myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Marguerite stayed her fierce reply that
she might slip the white stone between her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lips; and as she held it beneath her tongue
her anger suddenly melted. She thought
now of Etienne&rsquo;s hunger and weariness,
and was sorry that she had nought in the
house for him to eat. And as he sat in moody
silence she stole away, and begged some good
broth from her godmother, who had always
enough and to spare. This she placed before
him beside the hearth, and smiled, and spoke
in a gentle voice that made him turn to her
with a start&mdash;it was just as if the Marguerite
he loved had come back to him from the grave.
Then he drew her to him, hiding his face in
her dress; and for the first time since many a
long day there was peace between them.
Marguerite kept that white stone always, and
when she was tempted to speak in anger it
worked like a Fairy spell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t it one?&rdquo; I asked, as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i>
put on his cap again, and a delicious smell of
fried eggs and bacon came from the farmhouse
kitchen on the breeze.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not it,&rdquo; said <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i>, laughing
heartily, &ldquo;there were thousands like it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
beach, but you see it did just as well. For
if once a woman can be induced to hold her
tongue when she is angry, there&rsquo;ll be little
trouble &rsquo;twixt man and wife. This has been
so from all time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Cock-a-doodle doo!&rdquo;</em> cried the black cock,
strutting grandly in front of us. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i>
darted after him, and I left them to themselves
and went in to breakfast.</p>

<p>I did not see <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i> again, but I heard
a great deal about him from Madame Daudet,
the farmer&rsquo;s wife; she called him &ldquo;the plague
of her life.&rdquo; She said he hid her spectacles
every time that she laid them down, and that
it was quite impossible to make good butter,
for he would play tricks with the cream. I
think she was fond of him, all the same, for
when I mentioned his name her jolly old face
crinkled up into smiles, and she looked quite
pleased and happy.</p>

<p>One day when Father had gone to the village
to see some sick child whom the peasants
believed to have been gazed at with &ldquo;an evil
eye,&rdquo; because it seemed unable to get well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Madame came to me as I stood prodding with
a stick some fat black pigs who would not
stir.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since you are so fond of Fairy Folk,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;why not go to the valley, and see if you
can meet a Fée? I have never seen one myself,
but my great-great-grandmother came
across a bevy of them in a forest near Bayeux.
The loveliest one was their Queen, and my
great-great-grandmother talked of her beauty
until her dying day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I said. And she gave me
some brown bread and a golden apple, so that
I need not come home for tea. Perhaps she
wanted to get me out of the way, for the sick
child&rsquo;s aunt was coming to pay her a visit,
and she liked a gossip.</p>

<p>The valley was very still. Even the birds
seemed to have gone to sleep, and the stream
that trickled down from the hill tinkled very
softly, as if it had to be careful not to wake
the ferns that fringed its banks. As I looked
up the glade I saw a lovely little lady coming
slowly towards me, and my heart began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
thump in the queerest way. She wore a
trailing silvery gown, with a deep band of blue
at its border. Her shoes were set with tiny
diamonds, and her dainty feet moved through
the grass as prettily and as softly as the wind
does through the corn. She did not see me
until she had come quite close, for I stood in
the shade of a blossoming bush. As I took off
my cap, her fair face flushed deeply, and for a
moment I feared she would run away. So
I hastened to tell her that I was a Christmas
Child, and why I had come to the valley. At
this she smiled, and I saw that her eyes were
as blue as the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;though at
first I feared you. Such sorrow has come to
Fées through mortals that we are wont to fly
at man&rsquo;s approach. But a Christmas Child
is almost a Fée himself, and I may talk to
you. My name is Méllisande.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then she asked me to walk with her through
the wood, and I felt quite proud when she
took my hand. A cheeky little Elf, who overheard
me say that I would go with her anywhere,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
turned a somersault in the air and
burst out laughing, but I pretended not to hear.
It wasn&rsquo;t his business, anyhow, and I wished
that that walk through the valley had been
twice as long.</p>

<p>At the further end, quite hidden among the
larches, was a natural grotto of moss-grown
stones, and just inside it a heap of ferns,
piled up to make a throne that was fit for a
queen. Méllisande seated herself on this, and
I sat down at her feet.</p>

<p>We did not talk for a long while, for she
seemed to be thinking as she stroked my hair,
and I only wanted to look at her. After
awhile I asked her if she had been one of
the Fées that Madame Daudet&rsquo;s great-great-grandmother
had met in a forest near Bayeux.
She smiled and sighed as she told me &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
and a wood dove flew out of the trees and
perched on her shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; said Méllisande,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
&ldquo;there dwelt at the Castle of Argouges a noble
lord who was famous not only for his bravery,
but for the extreme beauty of his dark features
and slender form. All women loved him, but
though he served them with chivalry, as
became a knight, he sought his pleasure in
the woods and fields rather than in their
company. He knew what the brook was
humming as it gurgled over the stones, and
the wind told him all its secrets as it rustled
among the pines. Sometimes he wrote these
things on a sheet of paper and read them to
himself aloud as he lay on the green sward.
The Fées in the forest drew near to listen, for
the voice of this lord of Argouges was sweet
as the lute of Orpheus, and their lovely Queen
lost her heart to him. Day after day she
hovered by his side, sighing when he was
sad, and rejoicing when the words he sought
came quickly to his pen.</p>

<p>Once when he looked up suddenly he saw
her as in a vision. A silvery veil of misty
gauze half hid her exquisite form; and out of
this her face looked down upon him, pure as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
an angel&rsquo;s, but with the love of a woman in
her lustrous eyes. As he sprang to his feet,
she melted away in a white cloud, and close
to his ear he heard a mournful sigh, as if her
spirit grieved to part from his. And he wrote
no longer of flowing water or whispering wind,
but of the Lady of the Woods.</p>

<p>For many a day he saw her no more,
for Henry I of England coveted Normandy,
the ancient patrimony of his house, and sent
his armies to take possession of it. When
the city of Bayeux was besieged, the Lord of
Argouges was amongst its most gallant
defenders, and his resource and daring were
the talk of all. None who crossed swords
with him lived to tell the tale, for his courage
was equalled by his skill.</p>

<p>One morn a giant sprang from the enemy&rsquo;s
ranks&mdash;a lusty German, well over seven feet,
with the limbs of a prize-fed ox.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dare you to fight me singly, Lord of
Argouges!&rsquo; he cried, for he knew with whom
he had to deal. The soldiers near stayed their
hands to watch; the hearts of the Normans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
almost stood still, but the English exulted,
for surely now would the Lord of Argouges
bite the dust, and his fiery sword no more
work havoc in their ranks! Their dismay
was great when he proved himself victor,
though they would not have wondered had
they had vision to see how ever beside him
moved the shadowy form of his Lady of the
Woods, directing his arm that his aim might
be swift and sure, and oft-times interposing
her tender body between him and the German&rsquo;s
thrusts. Later on, when the gallant knight
fainted from his wounds and was left for dead,
she tended him pitifully as he lay on the
blood-stained earth, moistening his lips with
the dew of heaven, and whispering such sweet
thoughts to him that the weary hours were
eased by blissful dreams. He was still alive
when morning dawned, and was found by his
friends and carried into camp. Though
visible to him alone, the Lady of the Woods
was there beside his couch, and the terrible
sights and sounds that accompanied the merciful
efforts of those who tended the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
could not scare her away from him. When
his suffering was over, and he could raise
himself to eat and drink, she came to him no
more, and as his strength slowly returned he
was consumed with a passionate desire to
find her.</p>

<p>At length he was able to go home to his
castle, and once more he roamed the forest.
The songs of the birds were hushed by now,
and the trees under which he used to rest
were almost bare. It was autumn, for he had
been long absent, and even yet his step was
slow and his proud head bent with weakness.
He was sick with longing for his gentle
lady; &lsquo;If I do not find her, I shall die!&rsquo; he
cried.</p>

<p>Presently he came to a glade where the
naked boughs formed a splendid arch above
his head, and he saw a troop of horsewomen
riding toward him on snow-white steeds.
In their midst was his Lady of the Woods, a
bridal veil on her star-crowned hair, and
myrtle at her breast. He awaited her approach
in a trance of delight; nearer and nearer came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the prancing horses, their skins of satin
glinting in the sun. The cavalcade reached
his side; the Queen of the Fées dismounted
and stood beside him, while the ground at her
feet became a bed of lilies. The Lord of
Argouges threw himself on his knees amidst
their fragrance, gazing up at her with enraptured
eyes, as softly and shyly she bent
toward him.</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="ic003" id="ic003"></a>
<img src="images/ic003.jpg" width="368" height="491" alt="&ldquo;The Lord of Argouges threw himself on his knees&rdquo;" title="&ldquo;The Lord of Argouges threw himself on his knees&rdquo;" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;The Lord of Argouges threw himself on his knees&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;Once more I greet you, dear lord!&rsquo; she said,
and as she touched his forehead with her lips,
the birds still lingering in the forest burst into
joyful song. When the knight found words
to tell her of his great love, she plighted her
troth to him, but only he heard her whispered
promise that she would be his wife.</p>

<p>Once more she mounted her snow-white
steed; he seated himself behind her, and thus
they rode to the castle gates, accompanied by
her maidens. Here the Lord of Argouges
sprang to the ground; light as a wisp of
thistledown, she floated into his arms, and to
the amaze of the household, who had watched
the approach of the procession from the castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
windows, her horse, thrice neighing, changed
into a bird, and fluttered sorrowfully away.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Farewell, sweet Queen!&rsquo; her maidens cried,
and kissing their hands to her, rode swiftly
back to the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>Then the Lord of the Argouges drew the
Lady of the Woods across the threshold of
the castle, and so queenly was her beauty and
so gracious her demeanour, that even his aged
mother, jealous of the son for whom she
would have shed her life-blood, found no word
to say against his choice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My love for him is nought beside thine,&rsquo;
the Fée Queen pleaded very sweetly, &lsquo;for thou
didst bring him into the world, and hast
anguished for him as none else can. But I
too have suffered on his behalf; I pray thee,
let me love him too!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then his mother looked long and deeply
into the eyes of the woman who had dethroned
her from her dear son&rsquo;s heart, and what she
saw there filled her with peace. &lsquo;Be it as
thou wilt,&rsquo; she said, and that self-same night
the Lord of Argouges wedded his Lady of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Woods in the castle chapel, which was decked
with the fragrant lilies that sprang wherever
her feet had trod. The rejoicings lasted for
seven days, and the Lord of Argouges looked
as one to whom the gates of Paradise had
opened.</p>

<p>The Queen of the Fées was now to all
seeming a mortal woman, and so far from
regretting that she had laid aside her rank,
each day found her more content in her husband&rsquo;s
love, and by every womanly art she
knew she sought to please him. One favour
only she asked of him&mdash;that never in her
hearing would he mention the word &lsquo;Death.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you do, you will lose me for ever,&rsquo; she told
him fearfully, and he vowed by all that he
held most sacred that this dread word should
not cross his lips.</p>

<p>The years went on. The lovely Lady of
the Woods bore him fair daughters and gallant
sons, and all was well with the Lord of
Argouges. But one thing grieved him; since
the Fées&rsquo; sweet Queen had linked her lot with
his, she too was subject to the laws of Time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and her beauty waned with increasing age.
The gold of her hair was streaked with silver,
and her face lost some of its soft pink bloom.
Her lord spake no word of what was in his
mind as he looked at her earnestly one bright
spring morn, but she divined his regretful
thoughts, and full sorrowful were her own.</p>

<p>The Fées could not help her, since she had
left her fairy kindred to throw in her lot with
mortal man, and so, with woman&rsquo;s wit, she
determined that at the forthcoming festival
at the Court the splendour of her attire
should make her lord forget Time&rsquo;s changes.
She therefore summoned to the castle the most
skilful workers in silks and broideries, who
toiled in her service day and night, that she
might be richly adorned at the Royal Tournament.</p>

<p>Her gown was of azure satin, encrusted with
many gems, and her long court train glittered
and shone with gold and silver. Diamonds
blazed at her breast and neck, while a circlet
of rubies glowed in her hair. But their rich
red lustre made her pale sweet face look paler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
than ever, and she still gazed wistfully at her
glass though the Lord of Argouges waited
below, wondering what delayed her. At
length he sought her himself, and in spite of
his impatience, he could but admire her
resplendent attire.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have robbed the sky of his morning
glories!&rsquo; he told her gallantly. Then, as she
lingered still, his impatience returned: &lsquo;Fair
spouse,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it were well if Death should
send you as his messenger, for you tarry long
when you are bidden to haste!&mdash;Forgive me,
Sweet! I should not have said that word!&rsquo;</p>

<p>His remorse came too late, for the ominous
sound had scarcely crossed his lips when with
a cry of bitter anguish, his lady became once
more a Fée, and vanished from his sight.
Long and vainly did he seek her, for though
her footmarks are still to be seen on the
battlements of the Castle, and night after night
she wandered round it clad in a misty robe
of white, they two met on earth no more. She
is pictured still in the crest of the house of
Argouges, over its motto, &lsquo;A la Fe!&rsquo;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>I liked this story, but I wished that it had
not ended quite so sadly. When I said so
to Méllisande she turned her face away from
me, and I think it was a tear drop that glittered
on her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will tell you neither of Pressina
nor Melusina,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for both these Fées
lived to rue the day when they put faith in the
word of man. It was different with the fair
Norina. She demanded no pledge, for doubt
and distrust came not nigh her path, and her
love brought her only gladness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The shadows lengthened; the wood dove
flew off to rejoin her mate; and Méllisande&rsquo;s
lips began to smile as she thought of
another story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long, long ago,&rdquo; she went on presently,
&ldquo;when our beautiful Normandy was known
by another name, and formed part of the
kingdom of Neustria, which was given to the
Duke of Paris by Charles the Bald, there lived
a wise and noble lord who was said to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
magic powers. So gentle was he that the very
birds would perch on his shoulder and twitter
their joys to him, yet so brave and strong
that the proudest knight cared not to provoke
his wrath. He was skilled in the lore of
plants and herbs, and by means of a slender
hazel from the woods could tell where crystal
waters flowed deep in the bowels of the earth.
Full many a maid would have flown to him
had he lifted his little finger, but though he
was often lonely as he wandered beneath the
stars, his heart went out to none, whether of
high or low degree, and he preferred his own
company to that of a mate whom he could
not love.</p>

<p>One Mayday he was up at dawn, searching
the fields for a tiny plant which had some
special gift of healing. The grass was
spangled with myriad flowers, but he passed
them all till he came to the one he sought&mdash;a
small pale blossom of faintest lilac, with
perfume as sweet as a rose&rsquo;s. While yet he
held it in his hand he heard a cry; it was that
of some creature in pain, and forcing his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
through a prickly hedge, he found a pure
white dove with a broken wing lying under
a thornbush.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor bird!&rsquo; he exclaimed compassionately.
&lsquo;Who has dared to injure so fair a thing?&rsquo;
With tender hands he set the broken wing,
binding it to her side with three green leaves
and some long-stemmed grass, and fed her
with juice from the lilac flower as he soothed
her with gentle words. When he had stilled
her flutterings, he laid her on his breast, that
he might bear her home and tend her until she
could fly once more under the vault of heaven.</p>

<p>On he strode through the meadow, and high
in the sky the larks trilled their pæans of joy.
Never to him had seemed the earth so fair,
and the morning sun tinged his cheek with
gladness. Suddenly he felt the burden on his
breast grow heavy, and stayed his footsteps
in surprise. No longer did he hold a wounded
dove against his bosom, but a beauteous
maiden in pure white garb, with three green
leaves bound about her arm with stems of
grass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>He set her on her feet and stared at her in
amaze; she met his enraptured gaze with eyes
that shone like twin blue stars. Then her
eyelids fell; she drooped beneath his glance
as a fragile flower beneath the sun&rsquo;s fierce
wooing.</p>

<p>And as the wind sweeps over a field of
corn when it is ripe for reaping, love took
possession of him. Fée or woman, he swore,
this beauteous maid should be his wife if she
were willing, and he would guard her through
good and ill while life should last.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Art thou mine?&rsquo; he asked her presently,
hoarse for very joy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am thine!&rsquo; she said, for she had loved
him long, and had but taken the form of a
dove to try him. And taking her home to
his castle, they were wedded by the holy
priest.</p>

<p>No longer now was he lonely, no longer did
he wander solitary beneath the stars, for the
lovely Fée was as true and tender as mortal
woman, and made him a faithful wife. Sons
were denied them, but seven fair daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
came, and he called them after the seven gems
that graced their mother&rsquo;s diadem.</p>

<p>The maidens were of such supreme loveliness
that as they grew up to womanhood they
were known as the Seven Fair Queens; each
was without rival in her own style of beauty.
Pearl was fair as day, with a skin like milk;
Ruby&rsquo;s dark splendour was a gift from the
Queen of Night, and her red, red mouth the
bud of a perfect flower. The glorious hair of
Amber fell round her shoulders in shimmering
waves of light, and sunbeams lost themselves
in her lashes. Sweet Turquoise had her
mother&rsquo;s eyes of blue forget-me-not, while
Sapphire&rsquo;s were of deeper hue, and Amethyst&rsquo;s
that of the violet. Chrysolite&rsquo;s were a misty
green, like the sky in the early morning, and
no mermaid sang sweeter songs than she as
she sat on the rocks at low tide.</p>

<p>There came a time when the father of the
Seven Fair Queens fell very sick, and not all
his potions could prolong his days. His call
had come, and so closely were he and Norina
united, that one eve at sunset her life went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with his. For awhile their orphaned daughters
wept with grief as they paced the gardens,
or sat by the crackling fire in the great hall.
But youth cannot mourn for ever, and with a
second spring, glad hopes came back to them,
and once more they rode in the chase. Since
they were rich as well as beautiful you may
be sure they had many wooers, but all preferred
to reign alone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When we wed, it will be with Fées!&rsquo; they
said disdainfully. This angered their lovers,
and presently they were left in peace.</p>

<p>Full wisely did they use their parents&rsquo;
wealth, improving the land and making sure
provision for all dependant on their bounty.
On the coast of the Cotentin they built the
Castle of Pirou, which gave work to the poor
for several succeeding years, and when it was
finished they filled it with gorgeous tapestries
and all the treasures of art they could
collect. Here they lived in splendour, keeping
open house; no passing wayfarer, however
humble, need miss a welcome if he cared to
claim it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>They were still in the first full bloom of
their beauty when their fame reached the ears
of one of the great sea pirates, the dreaded
Vikings who rode the waves like giant birds
of prey. North, South, East and West, from
Norway and Sweden, and little Denmark,
they sailed in search of plunder, and such
was their love of fighting that they would, if
need be, challenge each other rather than allow
their swords to rust with disuse. Although
they robbed, they were brave men, and believed
themselves entitled to all they took. Their
vessels were small, and light of draught, so
they could penetrate many rivers, but the
great chiefs chose the sea for their battle
ground, and ravaged many a town and village
on the coast of France.</p>

<p>When the mighty Siegmund heard of the
Seven Fair Queens of Pirou, he resolved to storm
their castle and take the loveliest for his bride.
With this intent he set sail for the coast of
Cotentin with a gallant fleet. The wind and the
tide were with him; he reached it one soft spring
morning when the sea was a sheet of blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>As the vessel which bore him neared the
shore, the Viking espied a bevy of maidens
in a sheltered cove, where the sand lay in
golden ripples. Ruby and Pearl, and the
gentle Turquoise sported in a sun-kissed
pool; while Sapphire and Amethyst wove
wreaths of seaweed, and Amber was smoothing
her shining hair with a slender shell
of mother-of-pearl that the waves had thrown
at her feet. Chrysolite sat on a dark rock,
singing, and her soft clear notes rang
over the waters, enchanting Siegmund with
their music.</p>

<p>&lsquo;By Thor and Odin,&rsquo; he thundered, &lsquo;our
journey was well planned. Haste thee, my
men, and get me to that rock! That maiden
shall be my bride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boat sped swiftly, with Siegmund sitting
in the stern. His yellow locks streamed over
his stalwart shoulders, and his face was like
that of some eager god as he noted Chrysolite&rsquo;s
beauty. The maiden saw his approach; and
now the glad notes of her exquisite song
changed to a mournful rhythm. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
chanting the words that her mother had breathed
to her seven daughters as she lay a&rsquo;dying:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&lsquo;Women ye, my daughters fair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">(Cloudless spreads the sky);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when menace fills the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fées, as once was I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slender arm shall change that day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Into snow-white plume;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winged as birds, haste swift away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From thy threatening doom!&rsquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the last words left her sorrowful lips,
Chrysolite&rsquo;s sisters gathered round her; the
boat&rsquo;s keel grated on the sand, and Siegmund
sprang eagerly forward. At the same moment
the Seven Fair Queens of Pirou raised their
arms, and instantly these changed, before his
eyes, to fluttering wings. High in the air
mounted the maidens, and to the bewildered
gaze of Siegmund they were nought but a
line of snow-white birds flying westward in
single file high up in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>When Siegmund had somewhat recovered
from his amazement, he and his followers
sacked the castle, and pillaged the surrounding
country; it did them but little good, for a storm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>blew up as they sailed back northward, and
the ships that carried the stolen treasure were
wrecked on the rocks. As for the Seven Fair
Queens, they mated with Fées, and were
glad as the morning. Every year as spring
comes round, they return to Pirou with their
numerous descendants, in the form of a flock
of wild geese, and take possession of the nests
which they have hollowed out in the crumbling
walls. They also appear when a child is born
to the house of Pirou; if it be a daughter, and
Fate has destined her for a nun, one sits apart
in a corner of the courtyard, and sighs as if
in sore distress. If a son is born, the male
birds display their plumage, and show by
their mien that they rejoice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Méllisande rose from her throne of ferns,
&ldquo;It will be twilight soon,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we
must go. See! the mists are already rising in
the valley, and the night-birds awake and call.
Farewell, dear Christmas Child, farewell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, stooping down, she kissed my
forehead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Now I knew that Germany was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
very country for Dwarfs and Fairies, and
when I heard that this was where we
were going next I determined to be on the
look out. I did not see them, though, for
a long time after we arrived, for I was so
tremendously interested in everything else.
Even in the big cities where Father spent
hours and hours in the hospitals, watching the
wonderful things that the German doctors did,
most of the children looked plump and rosy,
and I didn&rsquo;t see any so thin and pale as those
we had left at home. One of the Herr Professors,
with whom we stayed, said that this
was because the State made so kind a Grandmother,
but when I asked him what he meant,
he only laughed.</p>

<p>I liked this professor best of all&mdash;he had such
a nice way of talking, and he loved Fairies as
much as I do. He said &ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach! So!&rdquo;</i> when I
told him I was a Christmas Child, and smiled all
over his kind old face. Then he put his hand on
my shoulder, and told me that I must remember
to do my part to make my birthday the gladdest
day in the year for everyone around me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is different in your country,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;but here, in the Fatherland, there is
scarcely a cottage home which has not its
Christmas tree, even if this is only a branch
of fir stuck in a broken pot, and hung with
oranges and golden balls. No child is so poor
but has his Christmas presents of cakes and
toys, for if his mother cannot provide them, she
tells his teacher in good time, and the teacher
sees that he is not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I thought this was a ripping plan, for it is
horrid when Santa Claus forgets you, and your
stockings hang all limp and flat, like mine did
last year. And I made up my mind, then
and there, that next Christmas there should be
a tree for all the littlest and grubbiest children
in my old home.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/ibw049.jpg" width="242" height="310" alt="Fat little things, with big blue eyes." title="Fat little things, with big blue eyes." />
</div>

<p>While Father was at the hospitals with the
Herr Professor, I stayed with Rudolf and
Gretchen, two of his grandchildren&mdash;fat little
things with big blue eyes, who stared at me
as if I had seven heads when I told them about
the Korrigans. Gretchen believed in Fairies
of all kinds, but Rudolf only in Dwarfs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Giants. He even said that Santa Claus was
just his own father dressed up, and declared
he had seen his old brown pipe peeping out
of Santa Claus&rsquo; pocket the last time he paid
them a visit. Gretchen said that if so, Santa
Claus had taken away the old brown pipe to
bring a lovely new one in its place, and Rudolf
told her girls knew too much. They were
both angry by this time, and their faces
looked very red. So I thought we had better
talk about Dwarfs and Giants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandfather says there are no Giants
now,&rdquo; Rudolph said seriously, &ldquo;but there are
plenty of Dwarfs in the hill which looks down
on the forest. I saw one there myself last
summer; he ran away and wouldn&rsquo;t speak to
me, as if he were afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without saying anything to Rudolf, who
might have wanted to come too, I started for
the hill directly after dinner, while he and
Gretchen were arguing again over the pipe
and Santa Claus. The Professor&rsquo;s house was
just at the end of the town, so I didn&rsquo;t have
far to go; but the hill took much longer to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
climb than I thought it would, and I was
quite out of breath when I reached the top
and sat down on a flat white stone. As I
looked about me, I swung my foot, and it
tapped against
a biggish rock
that was just
in front. The
third time that
I did this, a
little brown
man hopped
briskly out of
a crevice and
stood before
me. He wore
a bright red
coat trimmed
with green
buttons, and
carried in his hand a close-fitting cap of grey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gently, gently, good child!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;One knock is enough, if we want to hear it,
for our ears are as keen as we could wish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Why did you call me, and what would you
have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would hear of you, and of your kinsmen,
Master Dwarf!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I am a Christmas
Child, and the Fairies are all my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this he bowed, and said he was glad to
meet me, nodding his head with a sort of
grunt as I told him where I had met Titania.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be your pleasure,&rdquo; he said, looking
round to see that no one was near but me, &ldquo;I
will take you within the hill, and introduce
you to my wife. The ground whereon you
stand is hollow, as you will soon perceive,
and we are less than a stone&rsquo;s throw from my
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I told him that nothing would please me
more than to pay him a visit, and muttering
a word in some strange language, he rapped
his knuckles on a cleft in the rock. It
widened sufficiently to let us both through,
and closed again with a thud.</p>

<p>The winding passage in which I found myself
was lit by a soft red glow, coming
from hundreds of rubies set deep in the walls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which seemed to be of oxidised silver. After
several twists and turns, it ended in a wide
hall, where I could just stand upright under
the jewelled dome! As soon as my eyes grew
accustomed to the blaze of light which came
from the diamond stars set round it, I saw a
sweet little creature in a frock of pale purple
silk, cut short in the sleeves to show her
pretty white arms, on which she wore many
bracelets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife!&rdquo; said the Dwarf proudly, and he
explained to her who I was and what I wanted,
and a great deal more about me that I was
astonished he should know. My surprise
amused him a good deal, and as his wife led
the way to her boudoir he chuckled merrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are Kobolds, or House-Spirits in
most old houses,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;and it is
more than two hundred years since the first
stone was laid of the Herr Professor&rsquo;s. I
knew this noon that you were coming, and
the Kobold spoke well of you, and said that
you were not above taking advice from others
wiser than yourself. Now, sir! What do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
you think of this?&rdquo; And he opened a door
with a great flourish, holding it back for me
to enter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s grand!&rdquo; I said, for so it was. The
silver floor was inlaid with a gold scroll; the
walls, of tinted mother-o&rsquo;-pearl, were adorned
with wreaths of forget-me-nots, each tiny
turquoise flower having an amber centre.
The furniture was of filigree silver, so fragile
to look at that I was afraid to touch it, much
less to sit down on one of the tiny chairs, even
if I could have fitted myself in. The Dwarf
invited me to be seated, and his small wife
gave me a roguish smile as she brought a
velvet cushion from an inner room, and placed
this on the ground. I found afterwards that
it was the Dwarfs own bed, and that his
pillow was made of spun spider silk, filled
with scented roseleaves and wild thyme.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw051.jpg" width="382" height="503" alt="His little spouse offered me a sip of nectar" title="" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;When you are rested and refreshed,&rdquo; said
the Dwarf kindly, as his little spouse offered
me a sip of nectar from a crystal goblet, &ldquo;I
will show you my palace. There is not much
to see, for we are humble folk, and this hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
comparatively a small one. The estates of
some of our nobles extend for miles, and that
of our Emperor runs through a range of
mountains. In times gone by we welcomed
mortals as our guests, for we were anxious
to be their friends. But they grudged us even
a handful of peas in return, and met our
advances with jeers. Now we keep to our
hills as far as possible, and when we desire
to walk abroad, we are careful to wear our
mist caps, which render us quite invisible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sighed so deeply that the dainty lace
cap poised on his wee wife&rsquo;s hair was almost
blown away, and then, straightening his bent
shoulders, he took me to see his Banquet Hall.
The curtains were all of filigree silver, fine as
lace, and on the walls of the kitchen, where
silent little men in big white aprons kneaded
cakes on crystal slabs, shone ruby and sapphire
butterflies.</p>

<p>But this was nothing to what I saw in the
long low vault where the Dwarf kept his
treasures. At one end was a shimmering
heap of pearls, some larger than pigeons&rsquo; eggs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
at another, a conical mound of diamonds,
which threw out marvellous lights as the
Dwarf stirred them gently with one small hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know the properties of each stone,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;how some give strength, and some
wisdom and power to rule, while others still
stir up strife and envy, and make men merciless
as beasts of prey. That ruby you see
has an evil history; a woman gave her soul
for it, and thousands were slain in her cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I picked up the beautiful, glowing gem, and
fancied I saw the face of an evil demon
grinning at me from its depths. Dropping it
quickly, I looked instead at a pile of rings at
the other side of the vault. One in particular
drew my attention; it was of beaten gold, with
a curious stone set deep in its centre. As I
held it aloof and stared at it, I caught a glimpse
of a waving meadow, with a tiny path leading
past a brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the ring which the Queen of
Lombardy gave to her son, Otnit,&rdquo; said the
Dwarf. &ldquo;Come with me to the Court of Rest,
and you shall hear the story.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>This was the loveliest place which I had
yet seen in the palace. A circle of orange trees
in full bloom enclosed a space round a rippling
fountain, where from the gleaming beak of an
opal bird a stream of water splashed into an
emerald basin. The invisible wind that
stirred the petals of the orange blossom brought
with it the swish of the sea, and somewhere,
far off, a nightingale was singing.</p>

<p>The Dwarf seated himself on one of the
velvet cushions strewn on the ground, and
motioning me to take another, began his tale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otnit, Emperor of Lombardy, was one of
the greatest kings that ever lived. By force
of wisdom more than by might, he subdued
the surrounding nations, and his people looked
up to him as to a god. When the time came
for him to wed, no maid in his wide dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
pleased his fancy, for the wife he pictured in
his dreams was sweet and simple, though of
royal birth, and quite unspoiled by praise and
flattery. He told his ministers this, and they
shrugged their shoulders.</p>

<p>&lsquo;His Majesty desires the impossible!&rsquo; they
whispered amongst themselves, and so it
seemed until the Emperor&rsquo;s Uncle Elias, the
wild-bearded King of the Russians, told him
of a highborn maid who was as good as she was
beautiful, and had never yet been wooed by man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She shines o&rsquo;er other women as bright
roses do!&rsquo; he cried, and Otnit vowed to win her.</p>

<p>On the eve of his departure for Syria, where
she dwelt with her father the Soldan, Otnit&rsquo;s
mother gave him the ring you held, bidding
him take his horse and ride toward Rome
while gazing at the gem in the ring, that
what he saw there might direct his path.
The Emperor smiled, but wishing to humour
her, did as she requested, and rode through
the silver starlight thinking of his fair maid.
At early dawn, when the welkin rang with
the song of birds, he saw mirrored in the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a narrow pathway trodden in the green grass.
Making his way by this fragrant road, he
reached a linden tree by a lake. Here he
stayed his courser, and sprang to the ground,
peering beneath its boughs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never yet from tree came so sweet-breathing
a wind,&rsquo; he laughed; for lo! an infant lay
on the grass, his fair white frock fringed with
many gems. Otnit found it all he could
do to lift him, in spite of his strength, but
placing the little creature on the saddle,
declared his intention of taking him to the
palace, and putting him in his mother&rsquo;s care.</p>

<p>But this did not please Dwarf Elberich,
who for his own purpose had taken the form
of an innocent babe. He offered Otnit such
splendid ransom of sword and shield to set
him free, that the Emperor laid him down
again, and even allowed him to hold the
magic ring, by the wearing of which it had
been possible for him to see what is usually
hidden from mortal sight.</p>

<p>Now it was Elberich&rsquo;s turn, and being
once more invisible, he teased the Emperor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
his heart&rsquo;s content, dwelling on the anger of
the Queen-Mother should she find that her
gift was lost. Not until the Emperor was
out of patience, and on the point of riding
away did Elberich restore the ring to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now, O Otnit,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;since I see
you love well your mother, whom I loved long
ere you saw the light, I will help you to gain
your bride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Otnit was glad, for he knew that the
word of a Dwarf is ever as good as his bond.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year, &lsquo;when all the birds
were singing,&rsquo; the Emperor called his friends
together and bade them embark their troops
with his in the ships at anchor in the harbour.
The waters of the bay gleamed as a field of
gold as the stately vessels glided over them,
and for long the carols of the birds on shore
went with them on the breeze. Otnit&rsquo;s hopes
were high as he paced the deck, though he
grieved that the Dwarf had not come to join him.</p>

<p>At length the fleet reached the Eastern coast
of the Mediterranean, and there King Otnit
beheld a haven full of ships, far more in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
number than his own. &lsquo;I would that Elberich
were here, for he is skilled in warfare,&rsquo; he
murmured uneasily, for his men looked askance
at the fleet before them. The words had
barely left his lips when the sound of a laugh
came from aloft, and straightway the Dwarf
displayed himself. He had been in hiding
amongst the rigging, and was now at hand
to use his Fairy powers in Otnit&rsquo;s service.</p>

<p>Elberich&rsquo;s gift of a small round stone, which
he bade him thrust into his cheek, conferred
upon Otnit the gift of language, and enabled
him to impersonate a rich merchant with so
much success that his ship was allowed to
drop anchor in the harbour. When dusk
had fallen, and all was quiet, the Emperor
disembarked, encamping with his troops
among the rock-hewn burial places of the
ancient Ph&oelig;nicians, which abounded on that
coast. Here he abode for three whole days,
while Elberich sought the King of Syria,
demanding his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage
for his royal master. It was refused point
blank, and, more than this, the Soldan ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his unwelcome visitor to be put to death. But
the flashing blades of the guards cut the
empty air, and Elberich jeered at them finely.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ibw054" id="ibw054"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
&lsquo;Your daughter shall go to my lord of her
own free will,&rsquo; he cried to the Soldan, &lsquo;and
only so shall your skull be saved!&rsquo; He then
returned to the Emperor, who bade his troops
attack the city of Sidon.</p>

<p>A desperate battle with the heathen followed;
for awhile the enemy&rsquo;s numbers triumphed,
but not for long. The Emperor&rsquo;s charge
swept all before him, and the Soldan&rsquo;s soldiers
fell like corn before the scythe. Then the
Dwarf led the army to the Syrian capital; and
red as had been the field of Sidon, it was as
nothing to that of Muntabur, where men&rsquo;s
blood flowed as a crimson river.</p>

<p>While yet the battle was at its height,
Elberich made his way, unseen, to an inner
chamber of the Royal Palace, and though he
had come to rate the Princess for her father&rsquo;s
obstinacy, words forsook him in her presence.
So fair a maid he had never seen; her mouth
&lsquo;flamed like the rose,&rsquo; her flowing hair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the colour of rich red gold, and her lovely
eyes had the radiance of the moon. Elberich
drew her to the window, and by the aid of his
power over space, showed her King Otnit in
the thick of the fight. The sun fell full on
his upturned face, as, seated on his white
charger, he rallied his men for the final onslaught;
he looked as brave a knight as the
Princess had ever seen, and she lowered her
glance as Elberich told her how she could save
her father.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Death alone can wean King Otnit&rsquo;s desire
to wed you,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;His love for you passes
the love of man, and is withal as tender as
that of a woman for her child.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Much more Elberich spake to her to the same
purpose, and at close of day she allowed him
to lead her where he would. Together they
passed through a secret passage beneath the
Palace, and so through the royal gardens, to
a path which wound down to the field of battle.</p>

<p>Fighting had ceased for awhile, for the
heathen had been sore smitten; and since his
men had neither eaten nor slept for many long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>hours, the Emperor must needs let them rest
until dawn. Full of impatience at the delay
which kept him from storming the walls that
held the lady of his love, he paced his tent,
and turned to find her standing before him.
Her mouth flamed red as the reddest rose; her
eyes had the lustre of the harvest moon, and
her red-gold hair framed a snowy brow that
was white as the breast of a swan. Bending
his knee, he touched with his lips the hem of
her gown, and when the Princess gave him
her exquisite hand, he could scarce breathe
for rapture.</p>

</div>

<p>&lsquo;She is yours, O Otnit!&rsquo; cried the Dwarf;
and the Emperor lifted her on to his charger,
speaking to her with such tender and kindly
words that her fears were stilled. With
Elberich perched on the horse&rsquo;s mane, they
straightway rode to the coast, where the sails
of the Emperor&rsquo;s vessel swelled roundly in
the wind. On the summer seas of the blue
Mediterranean, they two were wed; and never
had mortal man a sweeter wife, or maid a
more gallant husband.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Dwarf had come to the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of his story, he very politely bade me goodbye,
and bowed me out of his Castle. A week or
two later we went to Saltzburg, and there I
had a real adventure.</p>

<p>The Professor with whom we were staying
hadn&rsquo;t a single grandchild, and as all his
books were old and dusty, to say nothing of
being written in German, I should have found
it rather dull if he had not lent me his
nephew&rsquo;s pony. I had learnt to ride as a
little chap, when we lived in the country. It
was lovely there, but no one was ever ill, and
Father had so few patients that we could
not stay.</p>

<p>The pony&rsquo;s name was Heinrich. He knew
his way everywhere, the Professor said, so
Father didn&rsquo;t mind my riding him alone, and
I had a ripping time.</p>

<p>One day we went to the Wunderberg, a big
hill on a wide bleak moor, which was supposed
to be quite hollow, and the favourite haunt of
Wild Women.</p>

<p>The ground was extremely bumpy, and
several times I was almost thrown out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
saddle. At last I got off, for I thought I
would rather walk.</p>

<p>It was a splendid morning, and I was glad
that I wasn&rsquo;t the Professor&rsquo;s nephew, away at
school, as I lay on my back and looked up at
the sky.</p>

<p>A small black beetle crawled over my hand,
but I was so comfortable that I scarcely stirred.
It crossed my cuff and climbed a blade of
grass; and as I watched it a shadow fell
between me and the sunlight.</p>

<p>A slender woman in a white gown was
standing close to me. Her face was thin,
and very wistful, and over her shoulders,
down to her very feet, fell a mantle of glistening
yellow hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hungry, child?&rdquo; she asked gently,
holding out to me a slice of fine white
bread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; I answered, for we had had
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sauerkraut</i> for breakfast, and I felt that I
should not want anything more to eat for a
long time. She looked disappointed, and
sighed as she threw the bread away. A bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
flew down and pecked it, but after a taste or
two he left it where it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then surely you are thirsty, and will
drink from my horn?&rdquo; she pleaded, showing
me a silver vessel with curious scrolls and
writings traced in gold, which had been hidden
by her beautiful hair. I took a sip from its
bevelled edge, and had scarcely swallowed
the first drop when I felt myself sinking
through the hill, the Wild Woman still beside
me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At last! At last!&rdquo; she cried, clapping her
shadowy hands as we stood in a wide hall lit
with amber light. &ldquo;O sisters, rejoice with me!
I have found a child, and his eyes, his eyes
are crystal clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent over me as she spoke, half smothering
me with her silken tresses, and I was so
afraid that those sisters of hers would hug me
too, that I scrambled away and I took to my
heels and <em>ran</em>.</p>

<p>But you couldn&rsquo;t get far in that place. It
was a miniature town, with silver streets and
golden houses, and gorgeous palaces in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
between. Every turn I took led to a wide
square filled with rose trees, where fountains
of gold and silver water bubbled and sparkled
in the mysterious pale green light. A flock of
brilliant humming birds whirred their wings
in my face so that I could not see where I
was going, and the Wild Women formed a
circle round me and began to sing:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0a">&ldquo;Only once did mortal child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By our silver horn beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Find a way to leave us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they call us strange and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt find us soft and mild.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Stay, and do not grieve us.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Their voices were very sweet, but when
they had sung that verse twice over, I did
not want to hear it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind staying with you for an hour
or two,&rdquo; I said, as they stopped singing, &ldquo;but
I shouldn&rsquo;t care to live here. I am a Christmas
Child, and there are other Fairy Folk I want
to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they looked at each other, and drew
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since he is a Christmas Child,&rdquo; said one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
&ldquo;we cannot keep him. You should have
known better, Sister Snow-blossom, than to
bring him here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could I tell,&rdquo; wailed Snow-blossom.
&ldquo;He seemed like any other boy, and would
just have fitted the green silk suit that I wove
so long ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas!&rdquo; the others sighed. &ldquo;The
longer he stays, the more it will wring our
hearts to part with him. Take him back to
the hill at once, dear Snow-blossom, and bid
him hasten home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But I didn&rsquo;t want to go just yet, for now
that they did not wish to hug me, I thought
they were rather nice. Their faces were like
pure marble, so still and pale, and their light
green eyes were very gentle. So I asked if
Snow-blossom might not show me round, as
the Professors did Father when he came to a
strange town. Her sisters still urged her to
send me away at once, before she had time
to grow fond of me, but she would not listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want with a mortal child?&rdquo;
I said, when I had been all over the empty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
golden houses, and had seen the tiny cathedral,
the model of the one at Saltzburg, set with
pearls and rubies, and many other precious
stones of which I did not know the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we are lonely,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;so lonely, child. Our only friends are the
little people who guard our treasures in the
centre of the earth, and we would fain have
mortals to bear us company. Once, long ago, a
goodly youth of noble birth was almost tempted
to sip from our silver horn, and had he done so
his home would have known him no more.
Sweet Stella, the fairest Wild Woman who
drew breath between the last faint pulse of
the night time and the glowing dawn of day,
waylaid him on the brow of the hill when he
was heated in the chase, but although he
craved the cooling draught she offered him,
he would not drink from her hand; her
exceeding beauty excited his suspicions, and
he guessed that she was no mortal maid.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me see what your wine is like before I
taste it!&rsquo; he said warily, taking the silver horn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>from her hands. He had no sooner grasped
it, than he sprang to his horse and rode away.
For many years the horn was kept amongst
the treasures of the House of Oldenburg, to
which he belonged, but at last, after many
generations, it came back to us. No one but
you and the little Karl has drunk from it
since then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were under the rose trees in the great
square, and I had found a seat in a ruby and
pearl pavillion, with queer golden faces staring
down on me from each corner. Snow-blossom
hid her face in her hands when I asked her
who was Karl, and rocked herself to and fro;
then she lifted her head and looked at me, and
I saw that she was crying.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but first come
close. For words have wings in the Wunderberg,
and I would not have my sisters know
I am grieving still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I sat down beside her, and then she began,
speaking very softly and slowly, with deep
sighs in between. The tears on her cheeks
seemed to shine like pearls, and her hair
gleamed more golden than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;There was once a poor man named Henzel
who should have been well content, for his girl-wife,
Gretchen, was good and sweet, and the black
bread he ate when his toil was over was pleasant
to his taste. His bed was warm, and his sleep
was sound. What could a man want more?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>But Henzel was ever full of complainings.
His neighbour, Johann, had married a rich
woman, and now owned a well stocked farm
with many herds. Each time that he met
him, Henzel sighed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might have done better than he,&rsquo; he
grumbled, even when he heard that Johann&rsquo;s
wife was a great scold, and did not allow her
husband a moment&rsquo;s peace. He looked askance
at his gentle Gretchen, who bore with his
rough moods tenderly, since once he had been
her lover. But she grieved in secret, for never
a good word had he for her now, and her
flaxen hair lost its shimmer of satin, and her
cheeks their dainty bloom.</p>

<p>She was digging in the cottage garden, for
Henzel would do no work at home, when a
very old man toiled slowly up the hill. His
clothes were dusty, and his staff was bent; he
looked very weary, and his voice, as he
bade her &lsquo;Goodmorrow,&rsquo; was faint and low.
Gretchen&rsquo;s heart was filled with pity; she
invited him to enter her tidy kitchen, and put
before him the best she had. It was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
much, but her strange guest thanked her
gratefully. While he rested, she went to the
forest, to cut him a strong oak sapling for a
staff. The old man had vanished when she
returned, and in his place sat a little Dwarf,
not more than twelve inches high.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ibw059" id="ibw059"></a>
<img src="images/ibw059.jpg" width="381" height="500" alt="In the old man&rsquo;s place sat a little Dwarf." title="In the old man&rsquo;s place sat a little Dwarf." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw060.jpg" width="381" height="499" alt="Henzel" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I perceive that you have a kind disposition,
Gretchen, which is better than a rich dower,&rsquo;
he said, waving his hand for her to be seated
also. &lsquo;You are already sufficiently blessed,&rsquo;
he went on, &lsquo;in being both virtuous and patient,
but I am willing to grant you your dearest wish.
Speak out, and tell me what you most desire.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Gretchen bent her brows, and pondered
deeply. If she asked the Dwarf for gold,
Henzel would rejoice, but she had lived with
him long enough to know that whatever he
had, he would still want more. Should she
ask for another husband, then, since the one
she had, had ceased to love her, and threw
her but scornful looks? Nay&mdash;that would be
wrong, for whatever happened she was
Henzel&rsquo;s wife. And the flush on her girlish
face became yet deeper, for a very sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thought had fluttered across her mind. She
would ask for a little child to lie on her breast,
and bear her company through the long nights
and days.</p>

<p>When the Dwarf heard her whispered
request, he smiled on her very kindly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are a true woman,&rsquo; he said, and disappeared
as Henzel crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who has been here?&rsquo; he asked, scowling
at the empty cup and platter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;An old, old man, who was tired and hungry,&rsquo;
Gretchen replied, and anxious to escape his
further questioning, she turned to the newly-kindled
fire, and put on a saucepan of broth
for him. But Henzel was very curious, for
strangers came that way but seldom, and
before long he had drawn the whole story
from Gretchen&rsquo;s lips, with the exception of
the Dwarf&rsquo;s offer to grant her a wish.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Did he not speak of rewarding you for your
hospitality?&rsquo; her husband persisted, guessing
that something had been kept back from him.
And Gretchen shyly told him for what she
had asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Fierce was Henzel&rsquo;s anger at her neglect of
this opportunity to make him rich. He stormed
and raved until poor Gretchen longed to hide,
and when at last his rage had spent itself, he
was sullen as winter clouds. She would have
minded this more had it not been for the dear
new hope that filled her bosom, and early in
the spring a little son was born to her.</p>

<p>What cared she then for Henzel&rsquo;s anger,
so long as it did not touch her child? It was
joy enough to feel the wee thing&rsquo;s fingers straying
over her face, to see his limbs grow round
and dimpled, and to hear him laugh as she
sang to him baby songs. Henzel went in and
out, taking little notice of either of them; his
thoughts were all absorbed in schemes for
growing rich, for the love of money held him
in its grip.</p>

<p>When little Karl was six years old his
mother died. Instead of sorrowing for her,
Henzel was glad, for now he could marry
the elderly widow in the next town who was
ready to exchange her wealth for a handsome
husband.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>So Henzel, too, had now a well-stocked
farm, but this brought him small satisfaction.
For his new wife was a greater scold even
than Johann&rsquo;s, and he dare not so much
as cross the threshold without taking off his
boots. As to Karl, he was sent to mind the
cattle on the Kugelmill close by; the little lad
was so ill-clad that his ragged tatters blew in
the winter wind. He was hungry also, for
his stepmother grudged him the simplest food,
and but that he shared their berries with the
birds, he must have starved.</p>

<p>When the hawthorns were white with the
snows of spring, and the daisies showed their
golden centres on the grassy slopes, we heard
him crying for his mother. Stella flew to his
side, and gathered him in her arms. Her
lovely hair covered his shivering limbs, and
the desolate child clung close to her as she
held the silver horn to his curved red lips.
His soft embrace set her woman-love on fire,
and veiling him in her golden tresses, she
brought him here.</p>

<p>He was happy with us&mdash;as happy as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
days were long. We wove for him garments
of silken sheen, and taught him to call us by
the sweet name of &lsquo;Mother.&rsquo; &hellip; One day
he begged us to let him play on the hill, so
we took him thither, hiding close by, that we
might guard him from harm. He was seen
by some wood-cutters working near, and they
took word to his father; but before he could
fetch him, we had spirited him away. Karl
never asked to play on the hill again, and all
went well with us for many years, till he
sprang into a gallant youth, with his mother&rsquo;s
eyes and a lordly will, unlike her yielding way.</p>

<p>And then? Ah me! His love for our
beautiful Stella grew fierce and wild&mdash;the love
of a mortal man for a maid. And since no
Wild Woman may wed, one night he bore her
away from our hill to the evening star, which
is the sanctuary of lovers. Thence she sends
glad dreams to motherless children, and to
lonely women who pine for love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did not stay much longer in the Wunderberg,
for somehow the scented air seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
have grown chilly. When I said to Snow-blossom
that I must leave her, she wept again,
and gave me a shining strand of hair to guide
me back to the moor. It turned into gossamer
when I reached the daylight, and floated softly
away.</p>

<p>Heinrich was still munching at the short
grass, and stared at me very hard when I
caught his bridle. I suppose he thought I
had been a long while gone.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever tried to count the raindrops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
you will know how I felt when for three whole
days it poured in torrents. I was alone in
the library, watching a hole in the wainscotting
through which a mouse had just poked her
head, when some one said &ldquo;<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Guten Morgen</i>&rdquo;
in a piping voice, and I knew this must be a
Kobold. I was rather surprised that I had
not met one of these House-Spirits before.</p>

<p>He was sitting on the edge of a bookcase&mdash;a
little brown man with a wrinkled, good-natured
face, and wearing no clothes. He
chuckled when I said that I would rather speak
English if he did not mind, and remarked that
all languages were the same to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you have met some cousins of
mine, the Brownies,&rdquo; he went on affably,
kissing his hand to the mouse, who popped
back to her hole as if he had shocked her.
&ldquo;They are good little chaps, but quiet and
humdrum. You always know what a Brownie
will do, but as for us&mdash;mortals can never tell
what a Kobold will be up to next. We make
ourselves quite at home in their houses, and
really own them, if the truth were known.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
But excuse me&mdash;I should not appear before
you in this undress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye the Kobold had
changed himself into a curly haired boy, with
smooth pink cheeks and a red silk coat, and
knickerbockers of dark green velvet. &ldquo;This
is my best suit,&rdquo; he explained proudly, turning
himself from side to side. &ldquo;I usually wear it
when I play with children who were born,
like yourself, at the blessed feast of Christmas-tide.
It is only one of my many disguises,
however, though I seldom allow myself to be
seen at all. I can even hide in the cast-off
coat of a harmless snake, and woe to him
who lays stick upon me or seeks to drive me
away. The Heinzelmänchen, as we are called,
can be bitter foes as well as powerful friends,
and &rsquo;twas an evil day for the city of Köln
when we marched out of it. It has never
prospered since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; I began, and the Kobold held
up his hand to stop me, puckering his baby
face into a dreadful frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Why? Why?&rdquo; he mimicked. &ldquo;How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
like the child of mortal man! Everything
has to tell its reason&mdash;you rob the peach
of its velvet bloom that you may find the
secret of its ruddy splendour, and the fairy
gems on the grass at dawn are to you but
water distilled from earth! You would know
how the tide finds a way to turn, why the
light of the stars transcends your rush-lights!
Elves and Fairies and such-like things are
driven away by your curiosity, as the Heinzelmänchen
were by Rosetta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I was going to ask who Rosetta might be,
but I remembered just in time that this would
be another question. The Kobold chose a
more comfortable seat, and told me of his
own accord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toward the end of the eighteenth century,&rdquo;
he began, &ldquo;the Heinzelmänchen, took up
their abode in the city of Köln, where Johann
Farina distilled the sweet-scented waters
now famous all over the world. When
first he blended the fragrant oils of bergamot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
citron, orange and rosemary, it was we
who whispered to him in what proportion
he should mix them, and how to imprison
their lasting perfume. Not only him did we
help, but wherever we came across a worthy
fellow who was poor but honest, we gave him
a lift up; such was Rudolph the tailor, whom
we found when a lad on the steps of the great
Cathedral, without a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">pfennig</i> in his pocket, and
with a wolf inside him big enough to swallow
a little pig. When we saw how readily he
returned a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">thaler</i> that rolled to his feet to the
feeble old woman who had dropped it, though
he might well have said he had not seen it
fall, we took him to our hearts, and swore to
befriend him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So!&rsquo; we said, one to the other. &lsquo;Rudolph
is worthy to be our comrade. He is a good
lad, and henceforth we will see that he does
not want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The first thing to be done was to procure
him decent clothing, for no one would employ
him while he went in rags. We did this by
pointing him out to the wife of a rich merchant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
who fancied she saw in his pinched white face
a likeness to the son she had lost long since.</p>

<p>Touched by the poor lad&rsquo;s poverty, she gave
him a suit of clothes which had lain by for
many a day, and on finding he was an orphan,
apprenticed him to a tailor. The lad worked
well. We took it in turns to sit beside him,
showing him just where to place his needle,
so that his seams were always neat, and
guiding his scissors so that he cut the cloth
to the best advantage. So skilful did he
become that, when his time was out, his
master begged him to stay on with him as head
assistant, and gave him a good wage.</p>

<p>A fine young spright was Rudolph now,
with jet-black hair and eyes like coals. His
master&rsquo;s daughters, Euralie and Rosetta, both
looked on him with favour, and for a time it
seemed that he knew not which to choose.
Euralie was small and slight, with eyes like
a dove&rsquo;s; Rosetta was tall and buxom, and
had she been free from the vice of curiosity
would have made him a model wife. She
was clever and industrious as well as witty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and when Dark Rudolph passed by the gentle
Euralie, and took Rosetta for his betrothed, it
was only the Heinzelmänchen who shook
their heads.</p>

<p>Never was grander wedding feast than his.
While he and Rosetta where still in church,
we brought to his house the finest drinking
vessels that we could lay our hands on, and
pots and pans of beaten copper that were the
envy of every housewife bidden as a guest.
There were fairy cakes in the silver dishes,
and luscious fruits such as grew in no western
lands; the wine in the ruby goblets was
honeyed nectar, and though his friends quaffed
deeply, their heads remained quite clear. A
proud man was Rudolph as he drank to his
bride, and she looked so happy and gay and
bright, that we resolved to take her, too, under
our protection.</p>

<p>And this we did. When her children
came, <a href="#frontis">we rocked the cradle</a> and sang them
lullabies while she baked and brewed, and
when they slept we scrubbed and polished
from garret to cellar, until her house was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
pride of the street. Often she would ask to
be allowed to see us, but we always refused,
telling her to respect our wish, and be content.
Still she would not rest, and nothing that
Dark Rudolph could say to her would induce
her to hold her peace.</p>

<p>He had now three shops instead of one, and
counted lords and barons among his customers.
No one could fit as he could, for we were
always at hand to nip in here or let out there,
and many a fine straight figure was the result
of our cunning skill. His fame spread far
through the neighbouring towns, and one
spring a great noble travelled to Köln to order
some rich apparel for himself and his suite.
Our busy tailor was at his wit&rsquo;s end how to
get it finished in time, for all his assistants
were working their hardest, and still they
were behind.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have no fear! Dark Rudolph,&rsquo; we cried,
when we found him alone. &lsquo;Send your men to
rest, and leave it to us. When you wake in
the morning you shall find all done.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We lost not a moment that livelong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
night&mdash;it was as if our needles had wings.
Just before cockcrow, the door of the workroom
creaked softly open, and there stood Rosetta
in her white nightgown, with her hair in two
long plaits, peering round the corner to see if
she could catch us at work. We were justly
enraged, but since we heard her in time to
render ourselves invisible, and also because
we loved Dark Rudolph, we decided to give
her one more chance.</p>

<p>It was our custom to leave the lower part
of the house at the hour of midnight, no
matter what we might be doing, and climb
the steep stairs that led to the bedrooms,
to watch that the ghosts which were free to
roam till cockcrow might not ruffle the
children&rsquo;s hair, or wake them with their long-drawn
sighs. Rosetta knew this, for she had
often heard us comforting the little Rudolph
when his sleep was disturbed by a bad dream,
and with gross ingratitude she tried to be-fool
us. One night, she strewed dried peas on the
top steps of the winding staircase, so that when
we came up we should lose our footing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
fall to the bottom, and thus she might see us
struggling on the ground. We knew perfectly
well, however, why she had bought the peas,
and stayed below. When she rose next
morning, she forgot the trap she had laid for
us, and tumbled headlong down the stairs.
While she groaned and moaned over her
broken ankle, the Heinzelmänchen marched
out of the town to stirring music, which was
heard by all the citizens. We sailed down the
Rhine in a phantom boat, which you may yet
see floating on its waters if you look for it at
the right time. And Dark Rudolph and his
Rosetta sighed for our help in vain.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw065.jpg" width="381" height="97" alt="The phantom boat" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Kobold was a most entertaining little
fellow, and stayed with me all the morning,
telling me of well known House Spirits of
days gone by. One of these tales was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw066.jpg" width="374" height="355"
alt="The Little white Feather." title="The Little white Feather." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Hinzelmann,&rdquo; said the Kobold solemnly,
&ldquo;was a Spirit who haunted the castle of
Hudemühlen, though it was not until late
in the sixteenth century that those who lived
there were aware of his presence. He seemed
of so friendly a disposition that the servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
became quite used to him. They never saw
him, but he would often talk with them while
they worked, telling them of what went on in
the Underworld, and of the mighty Giants of
bye-gone days who had been created in order
to protect the Dwarfs from savage beasts, but
had become themselves so savage in the course
of the ages that they had to be done away with.
In time the lord of the castle heard of his
strange visitor, and sent him a message saying
he desired his presence at a certain hour.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No need to wait until then, good Sir!&rsquo;
laughed Hinzelmann over his shoulder. &lsquo;I
assist each morning at your lordship&rsquo;s toilet,
though you do not perceive me, and I blunt
your razors when you are out of temper.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This displeased the lord of the castle, for
he thought it unseemly to be on terms of such
familiar intimacy with a bodiless House-Spirit.
When he rebuked him for his presumption,
Hinzelmann laughed more loudly still. &lsquo;Better
men than you have to put up with my company,
if I will!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;and, believe me, I do not
intend to leave you!&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The nobleman grew more and more uneasy,
for it disturbed him to feel that he was never
alone. Hinzelmann whistled and sang through
the State rooms, and when his lordship
expressed irritation this was the House-Spirit&rsquo;s
favourite song:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;If thou here wilt let me stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good luck shalt thou have alway.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if hence thou dost me chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luck will ne&rsquo;er come near the place.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He hummed this morning, noon, and night,
until the lord of the castle was sick of it.
&lsquo;Since I cannot drive this fellow away,&rsquo; he
said at last, &lsquo;I must e&rsquo;en go myself;&rsquo; and telling
no one of his intentions, he summoned his
coach and set out for Hanover. On the way
he noticed that no matter how fast his horses
went, a little white feather danced above their
heads. Although he wondered at this, he did
not connect it with the House-Spirit, and when
he arrived at his chosen Inn, sought his couch
with a mind at ease.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank heaven,&rsquo; he muttered, as he turned
him over and went to sleep, &lsquo;I am free at last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
of this troublesome Hinzelmann. By the time
I see fit to return home, he may have gone
elsewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ibw066" id="ibw066"></a>
<img src="images/ibw067.jpg" width="384" height="501" alt="A little white Feather danced above their heads." title="A little white Feather danced above their heads." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw068.jpg" width="384" height="503" alt="Hinzelmann" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p>Next morning he missed his fine gold chain,
which was an heirloom, and, greatly distressed,
he haughtily demanded of the Innkeeper that
his servants should be searched.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They have robbed me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;and they
shall suffer for it! Cannot one sleep at your
house without meeting with knaves and
thieves?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this the Innkeeper was very angry.
Instead of condoling with the nobleman on his
loss, and offering to make it good, he roundly
rebuked him for taking away the character of
honest men without due proof. The noble
was leaving the Inn in much haste when a
soft voice asked him why he was troubled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it be on account of the bauble upon
which you set such store,&rsquo; it continued, &lsquo;look
under your pillow and you will find it. You
cannot get on without Hinzelmann after all!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would I had never known you, base
spirit!&rsquo; stormed the nobleman. &lsquo;You have put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
me greatly in the wrong with all these men, and
my journey has been for nought, since you are
here. If you do not quit me I will leave this
country; it is not wide enough to hold us both.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Hinzelmann spoke to him with much
reason, pointing out that he wished him no
harm, and that it was impossible to shake
him off, since wherever the lord went, he
could follow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was I who flew as a little white feather
in front of your coach,&rsquo; he concluded. &lsquo;You
played the part of a poltroon when you fled
from what you believed to be evil, instead of
fighting it on your own ground. Come back
with me, and if you give me your friendship,
I will work but good to you and yours.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the nobleman went back to his castle,
and Hinzelmann lived there with him. A
little room was set aside for his use in an
upper story, and here they placed, by the
nobleman&rsquo;s orders, a small round table, and a
tiny bed. No one could ever make out if he
slept on this, but once when the cook entered
very quickly, to take him the dish of new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
milk and wheaten crumbs which was placed
each morn on his table, she saw a shallow
depression on the down pillow, as if something
very small and soft had rested there.</p>

<p>When the time came for Hinzelmann to leave
the castle, he presented its lord with three fairy
gifts, the last of these being a leather glove
richly wrought with pearls in a curious pattern
of snails and scrolls. So long as this glove
was in possession of his house, he told him, so
long would his race flourish. And thus he
requited the kindness which had been shown
him. There is nothing that we like better
than to help our friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; I said, nodding my head. And
the House Spirit smiled as if this pleased him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We need take no credit for this,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;since the Dwarf King himself sets
us the example. His rescue of the poor old
couple at Schillingsdorf is but one of many
instances of the way in which he gladly helps
those who show hospitality to him or his.</p>

<p>Caught in a storm, he wandered from door
to door, entreating each person who answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
his knock to let him enter and warm himself.
One and all they refused, for his green velvet
garments were stained and draggled, and they
had not the wit to see that in spite of his
dripping clothes and dishevelled beard he was
still every whit a king. At last he came to
the hut of an ancient shepherd, whose little
old wife was as thin as he, for food had been
very scarce. The moment she saw the wanderer,
her heart went out to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come in and welcome, you poor little fellow!&rsquo;
she said, setting wide her door. &lsquo;Our fire
is not much to boast of, but &rsquo;tis better than
none on a night like this.&rsquo; And the shepherd
hobbled to the inner room that he might bring
his Sunday coat, and place this round their
visitor&rsquo;s shoulders while his own lay drying
on the hearth. Then the old woman spread
a white cloth on the table, and gave the Dwarf
her share of the coarse black bread which was
all her cupboard contained.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thank you, my friends,&rsquo; he said, breaking
the bread into two fragments. As he did so,
one became a fine white loaf, and the other a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
noble cheese. The Dwarf laughed at the old
couple&rsquo;s amazement, and bade them feast to
their heart&rsquo;s content.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So long as you leave on the platter a crust
of bread and an inch of cheese,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;so
long will a fresh loaf and a fresh cheese spring
from these fragments during the night; but
if ever a beggar entreats your help, and you
refuse him, they will turn to dust and ashes.
Now I bid you farewell, but ere long we shall
meet again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he went out in the rain, despite
their entreaties that he would at least stay with
them until the storm was over.</p>

<p>Little sleep did they have that night, for
wind and rain swept through the valley.
Torrents roared down the mountain side,
flooding the wooden houses, and even worse
befell at daybreak. An enormous rock snapped
off from a topmost peak, and carrying with it
great masses of stones and uprooted firs,
crashed down on the little village. All living
things were buried beneath its weight except
the shepherd and his wife, whose cottage yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was spared. Tremblingly they stood on the
threshold, for they thought their last hour had
come.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thou hast been a good wife, my dear one,&rsquo;
breathed the shepherd, as he drew her frail
form close to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is well that we should go together, since
thou hast lain by my side for nigh sixty years,&rsquo;
she whispered, hiding her face against his
breast.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How now?&rsquo; cried a reassuring voice. &lsquo;Dost
despair so easily?&rsquo; And looking up they saw
their friend the Dwarf riding on a rough raft
in the centre of the stream, and steering before
him the trunk of an immense pine. This he
proceeded to fix crosswise in front of their little
garden, so as to form a dam. The torrent now
passed by the cottage, leaving it undisturbed,
and the voice of the wind was hushed. The
sun came out, and the birds sang; but the only
people alive in Schillingsdorf were the shepherd
and his old wife.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The forest paths were dappled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sunlight as Father and I strolled down its
winding glades, and all the wood things were
chirping and chattering with joy. Now and then
something brown and furry scuttled across our
path, and once I all but trod on a tiny mouse,
who had hidden herself under last year&rsquo;s leaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You clumsy boy!&rdquo; said a tiny voice, and I
turned in time to catch sight of a wee pink Elf
as she sprang from the flower Father wore
in his button hole upon a bright blue butterfly
which had been hovering above her for
some time, and now darted swiftly away.</p>

<p>After a while we came to an open space
where the woodmen had been felling timber.
Several great trees still lay on the ground;
one was particularly straight and round,
and I noticed three wide crosses cut deep into
the bark. I thought I would like to carve my
name there too, for my knife had been most
beautifully sharp since the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nain Rouge</i> touched
it, so when Father sat down soon afterward
to read his letters, I went straight back to the
spot. As I reached it I heard the distant baying
of hounds; the sound came nearer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
nearer, and mingling with it were shouts in
a strange deep voice, which almost frightened
me. As I looked up, my knife was jerked
out of my hand by a little woman dressed in
green, who pushed me breathlessly aside and
sat down, sobbing bitterly, on the middle
cross. I was still staring at her when there
flashed through the air a huntsman on a fiery
horse, followed by many hounds. Their
hurrying feet knocked off my cap and rumpled
all my hair. They had passed in a second,
and next moment I heard their baying far away.</p>

<p>The little woman in green sobbed still, but
she seemed to be growing calmer. Her hair
and eyes were a soft light grey, and her frock
was most prettily trimmed with tufts of moss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; I thought when I noticed this,
&ldquo;you are one of the Moss-women, I&rsquo;ve no
doubt.&rdquo; For I knew that these were supposed
to haunt the forests of Southern Germany.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was the Wild Huntsman,&rdquo; said the
little thing, looking at me trustfully. &ldquo;But for
the kindness of the woodcutters who make
these marks in the trees they fell, I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
have fallen to his bow and spear. When we
can find three crosses we are safe, for he dare
not touch us then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I waited to hear what else she would say,
for I thought of the Kobold&rsquo;s &ldquo;<em>Why? Why?
Why?&rdquo;</em> and did not like to ask her questions.
In a little while her lips were smiling, and
swaying to and fro, as a tree sways in the
wind, she began to sing. I knew I had heard
that song before, but I could not think where
until I remembered that the pines which
rustled against the windows of my night
nursery had often sung it when I was small.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the song of the wind,&rdquo; she told me,
&ldquo;and the very first sound we hear. We are
born in the roots of the tree which is to be our
home, and when this dies, we must die too.
So long as the sap runs through its branches,
and the bark is not cut or injured, we are
safe and sound in our snug recess, but at
certain times we are bound to leave it, to seek
for food, or to attend our lords. It is then that
we are in such grave danger&mdash;and all because
Elfrida tried her witcheries on a stranger.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo; I could not help asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said the Moss-woman sadly,
&ldquo;and then you will understand why even the
youngest of us has now grey hair.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;Elfrida was the fairest of our race,&rdquo;
she sighed, &ldquo;and her palace the tallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and straightest pine that ever raised its
boughs to Heaven. When she left its
shelter at early dawn to bathe in some
sparkling stream, or seek for sweet berries in
the thickets, the Flower-Elves flocked to greet
her; wild roses gave her their bloom for her
oval cheeks, and the violets scented her sunny
hair. Wherever she passed, the moss grew
a brighter green, and she had but to breathe
on a gnarled old trunk, and the softest
feathery fronds came to hide its ugliness.
The creatures of the forest were all her friends,
and took pride, as we did, in her loveliness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Have a care, Elfrida&mdash;a stranger comes!&rsquo;
cried a squirrel one summer morning, staying
his dancing feet to warn her. His up-cocked
ears had caught the thud of some well-shod
charger&rsquo;s swift approach, and he guessed he
would not be riderless.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go back to thy palace, dear child!&rsquo; cooed
a motherly pigeon who had reared many
broods of snowy fledglings, and misdoubted
the sparkle in Elfrida&rsquo;s pale green eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Haste thee home, Elfrida!&rsquo; cried the stream<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
as it gurgled over the stones; &lsquo;haste thee home,
and hide thy face from the sunlight.&rsquo; But
Elfrida pretended not to hear as she shook
out the crystal drops from her gorgeous hair.</p>

<p>The horse and his rider were close to her
now; the huntsman blew his golden horn,
and in the excitement of the chase might have
passed her by, unseeing, but for his hounds.
In a moment they had surrounded her, baying
like hungry wolves, and Elfrida sprang to a
branch that overhung the water, where her
white limbs gleamed against its green. The
huntsman sent the dogs to heel, and dismounting
from his horse, entreated the
maiden to come down to him. Nothing loth,
Elfrida coyly descended, and the huntsman
was amazed anew at her perfect form. He
sat at her feet through the hush of noonday,
and at even he was there still. When the
moon turned the glades to silver, Elfrida left
him, but she promised to meet him again
next day, and he could not sleep for thinking
of her.</p>

<p>But although she smiled on him sweetly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
as she lay on the banks of the stream, and
listened with languid pleasure to his fond
fierce wooing, which passed for her many an
idle hour, she would not consent to be his wife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I like best the gems that I find on the lilies
at daybreak,&rsquo; she said, when he vowed that
the richest jewels that the earth could give
should deck her fair white arms. &lsquo;You must
offer me something rarer than these if I am
to forsake my kindred to go with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the huntsman swore that he would
give her all he had; only his honour would
he hold back, for he was sick with love
and longing.</p>

<p>Now behind Elfrida&rsquo;s loveliness dwelt a
spirit of malice and wanton cruelty, and
though she loved not this wild Huntsman,
and had no intention of being his bride, she
wished to see how far her power over him
could go. So she asked of him these three
things: the crest of his House cut in the
stone over his castle gates, where it had
stood for centuries; the leaf from his dead
mother&rsquo;s Bible, whereon she had written the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
date of her marriage day, with the names of
the children born to her; and his father&rsquo;s sword.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, Sweetheart!&rsquo; cried the Huntsman.
&lsquo;Ask me for aught else in the world, but not
for these things, since they touch my honour!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;These will I have, and nothing less,&rsquo; said
Elfrida wilfully, looking at him through her
long gold lashes until his soul went out from
him. His face was white as milk as he rode
away, and the creatures of the forest cringed
with shame. For they knew she had asked
what was unseemly; and they ceased to attend
her when she went to the stream at dawn.</p>

<p>When the moon was at her full the
Huntsman returned with the three gifts, and
now he thought to take Elfrida in his arms.
But she thrust him from her with bitter
words, tearing the leaf from the sacred Book
into a thousand shreds, and tossing the crest
and sword into the running stream.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; she cried, and her scornful laugh
rang through the woodland, &lsquo;shall I, Elfrida,
be the sport of a man who holds the honour
of his house as something less than a maiden&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
whim? I will have none of you&mdash;get you
gone!&rsquo; And she flung out her arms to the
strong North Wind, who caught her to him
and bore her off. But not to her high pine
palace did he take her, for he was angry
because of her cruelty; and far away at the
grim North Pole, she shivers yet under the
thickest ice. Her green eyes shine through
the frost-bound floes, and light the depths of
the Northern seas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Huntsman?&rdquo; I questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He died in his rage, where Elfrida left
him!&rdquo; said the Moss-woman mournfully, &ldquo;and
his spirit seeks still to avenge his wrongs.
To the last of our race it will pursue us, until
none of our kindred lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chris! Chris! where are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Father&rsquo;s voice, and the Moss-woman
vanished. Father wanted to read me a funny
letter from the Locust, who complained a lot
of being called up at night by patients who
had no money, and wouldn&rsquo;t have paid him
even if they had. This was the way they often
treated Father, but he said &ldquo;Poor beggars!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and then forgot it, while the Locust was very
cross.</p>

<p>Next day I went back to the forest, hoping
to find the Moss-woman again, but she was
not there. I found instead an Elf who was
almost too small to be seen. She told me that
she and her sisters lived in the cells which
make leaves so green, and mixed things they
drew in from the air and sunlight with the
water that came through the roots, turning
these into sugar to feed the tree. It sounded
like magic, and I was so much interested that
I almost forgot to ask about the Moss-women.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little things!&rdquo; said the Leaf-Elf
kindly, when I said I had seen one. &ldquo;It is
well that the woodcutters are their friends,
or they would fare badly. Many a meal did
they have from them in past times, and even
Hans the Unlucky never grudged them what
he gave. They paid him back for it, never
fear, for they do not forget a kindness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo; I asked. And this is what
she told me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw073.jpg" width="371" height="355"
alt="The Luck of Hans." title="The Luck of Hans." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the unlucky mortals, Hans was
surely the most to be pitied, for though
he was honest and frugal, nothing he
touched seemed to prosper. The farm had
done well in his father&rsquo;s lifetime, but after he
died there was not one good season for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
three bad ones. Far from being idle, Hans
was up before dawn, and still hard at work
at sundown. His mother sent away her maids,
since she could not pay them their wages, and
kept the house straight herself; where could
you find a worthier pair? But Hans&rsquo; affairs
went from bad to worse, and when (at the
busiest time of the year) his mother lost her
sight and became quite blind it was clear he
was born to be unlucky.</p>

<p>The farm went to rack and ruin, and there
came a time when Hans was forced to go off
to the forest to fell a tree that his poor old
mother might have fuel to warm her. When
the sun was high, he drew out his lunch, and
a poor little Moss-woman stole out from the
undergrowth to beg a few crumbs for her
hungry children.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take it all!&rsquo; he cried, thrusting his bread
into her tiny hands. &lsquo;It is waste of good food
for a man to eat who is as unlucky as I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I cannot repay you in kind, friend Hans,&rsquo;
said the Moss-woman, &lsquo;but I will give you
some good advice. In the house by the mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
lives a sweet young girl, with a face tinged
with pink like a daisy&rsquo;s. She has loved you
long, for you are her mate. Take her to wife,
and your luck will turn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans flushed deep crimson beneath his tan,
and the veins on his forehead grew tense and
hard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;&rsquo; he stammered; &lsquo;you must
mean Elsa? And Elsa, you say, Elsa cares
for <em>me?</em> It can&rsquo;t&mdash;it can&rsquo;t&mdash;be true.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A woman&rsquo;s heart goes where it will,&rsquo;
answered the Moss-woman. &lsquo;Try your luck,
friend Hans, and lose no time. Life is short,
and the days are flying.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hans went at once to the house by the mill,
for had he not gazed at it time and again as
the casket which held his treasure?</p>

<p>When Elsa saw him coming with that look
upon his face, she twisted a ribbon, blue as
her eyes, in the pale gold plait that crowned
her head, and went shyly down to meet him.</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="ic006" id="ic006"></a>
<img src="images/ic006.jpg" width="360" height="473" alt="&ldquo;Went shyly down to meet him&rdquo;" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;Went shyly down to meet him&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>Hans said not a word, but he found a way
to make her understand, and his eyes spoke,
though his lips were dumb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>They were betrothed and married within
the month, and little cared sweet Elsa that her
friends marvelled at her choice. She comforted
the sad blind dame, whose son was now her
husband, as a happy woman comforts one
who fears she has lost all, and behold! the
old woman smiled again. As to Hans, the
neighbours scarcely recognised him when they
met him in the markets; she trimmed his
beard, did Elsa, with her own hands, and
mothered him as if he were a child of seven.
His fields grew green, and then golden with
harvest; his scanty flocks increased and
multiplied.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hans&rsquo; luck has changed!&rsquo; the neighbours
said, and they scoffed at him no more.</p>

<p>But good luck itself does not last for ever,
and after three years of plenty came a bad
one for all in those parts. There was a long
and unusual drought, followed by so much
rain that the roots rotted in the ground, and
sickness spread amongst sheep and oxen.
Hans lost all that he had re-gained, and to
add to his misfortunes, he chopped his hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
instead of a log of wood, and could do no
work for weeks. He was in despair, and the
old blind woman beside his hearth wept and
wailed from morn till eve.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would I were dead,&rsquo; she moaned. &lsquo;I am
a useless burden, for I cannot even knit. My
store of wool is exhausted, and we have no
money to buy more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Mother,&rsquo; said Elsa tenderly, &lsquo;who
has a greater right than you to the last penny
that Hans possesses? You carried him on
your breast when he was small and helpless,
and have loved him faithfully all these years!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the mother turned her face to the wall
and wrung her idle hands.</p>

<p>Then Elsa sold the ring that had been her
lover&rsquo;s gift in order to buy for her soft
white bread and warming cordials, and wool
wherewith to ply her needles. As she returned
home with her basket, grieving to think of
the pain of those she loved, a Moss-woman
accosted her in the forest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have nought for my children to eat,&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>she said. And Elsa, pitying her the more
that she herself was hungry, gave her a
share of what she had, even to a skein of the
wool, that she might weave a coat for her
crying babe.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait for me here!&rsquo; cried the Moss-woman
earnestly, and Elsa leaned sadly
against a tree, too weary to be surprised. In
a moment or two the Moss-woman returned,
carrying a grey ball of wool and some chips
of wood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give the wool to the old crone who weeps
by your hearth,&rsquo; said the little thing, &lsquo;and
the chips to Hans. He is lucky in his wife,
if in nought else!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she disappeared, and Elsa went
quickly home. Thinking to win a laugh
from her husband, she opened her apron to
show him the Moss-woman&rsquo;s gifts, and, to her
amazement, found that the chips had turned
to yellow gold, and the little grey ball of wool
into a large one of fleecy whiteness, so soft
and thick that it felt like velvet! The golden
chips stocked the farm again, for they were of
pure metal, and weighty, and the ball of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
white wool was never exhausted during the
old woman&rsquo;s life time. She knitted away
until her hundredth year, and when, long
afterward, the summons came also for Hans
and Elsa, in their turn, their children had
good cause to bless the name of the Moss-woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was to Italy we travelled next,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to stay with the Signor, who had lived in
England once, and was a patient of Father&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>It was fearfully hot when we arrived, and
most English people had gone away; but
Father and I could bear a lot of sunshine,
and we did not go out in the middle of the day.</p>

<p>In the early mornings I went off to explore
while Father was still asleep. Sometimes I
made for the hills, but often I chose the city,
for I liked to wander through the streets and
make friends with the chattering children.
They were jolly little beggars, with bare
brown feet and thick dark hair that fell over
their faces. My favourites were Giovanni
and Mariannina; their mother worked for a
grand Contessa who lived not far from the
Signor. Giovanni was thin as a reed, but
Mariannina, whose curly head did not reach
her brother&rsquo;s shoulders, was as plump as a
partridge, and her cheeks were red instead of
brown. Adelina, the Signor&rsquo;s housekeeper, told
me their names, and that Mariannina was the
pride and torment of Giovanni&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He adores her,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
surely bewitched. She runs from him like a
squirrel, and is an imp for mischief. Ah,
the poor Giovanni&mdash;he has his hands full!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this I often met them, and if
Mariannina were in a good humour she
would smile at me through her lashes, while
if she were cross she would frown like a
Witch, and even shake her tiny fist. At this,
Giovanni would look quite shocked, and
would beg me in broken English not to be
hurt at &lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la sorellina&rsquo;s</i>&rsquo; unkindness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She so ver&rsquo; small!&rdquo; he pleaded wistfully,
and this was always his excuse for her.</p>

<p>One day she took it into her head to run
away from him, and darted into the middle
of the road, almost under the heels of some
prancing horses. I happened to be close by,
and seized her red skirt just in time to drag
her back. Panting with terror, Giovanni took
her from me, and when he found she was not
hurt, for the first time in his life he shook her.
And then he tried to kiss my hands; I almost
wished I had left Mariannina to be run over.
Before I could get away from him, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
thrust upon me the small gilt cage he always
carried about with him, and had but just now
tossed on the ground. It held his cherished
&lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">grillo</i>,&rsquo; or cricket, a curious pet of which all
his playmates seemed very fond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is yours, it is yours!&rdquo; he cried, and
seemed so grieved when I tried to give it back
to him that I was obliged to keep it.</p>

<p>The cricket was a merry little creature,
with a very loud voice for his size. &ldquo;<em>Cree-cree-cree!&rdquo;</em>
he chirped, as I carried him to
the villa, and he never once stopped all day.
I believe that he sang the whole night
through, for I heard him in my dreams; and
when I woke I determined to set him free.</p>

<p>I carried the little gilt cage up the slope
of a hill before I opened the door. No sooner
had he hopped on the grass, when his &ldquo;<em>Cree-cree-cree</em>&rdquo;
was taken up by hundreds of other
crickets, who gathered round him in great
excitement, chirping with all their might. As
I put my fingers into my ears, a little old
woman appeared from nowhere, and with a
wave of her hand sent them all away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Many mouths make a small noise great,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and you are not the first to be
wearied by the crickets&rsquo; song. The Sorcerer
of the Seven Heads<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> liked it as little as you
did, and the White Princess owes her happiness
to this. I say what I know, for I am
her Fairy Godmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they told me there were no Fairies
in Italy!&rdquo; I cried. And then I was sorry
that I had spoken, for the little old woman
grew pale with rage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No Fairies?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Ah, foolish
ones, worse than blind! Had you not believed
them you had seen countless Witches and
Fays ere this, for Ascension Day has come
and gone, and they are all set free. Besides
these, there are Goblins and Spirits, and
fearsome Incubas, and shadowy Fates who
sway men&rsquo;s destinies. All these abound in
our sunny Italy for those who have eyes to
see; and there are also Fairy Godmothers,
such as I. The maidens for whom I stand
sponsor comb jewels out of their hair;
diamonds and pearls, rubies, and shining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>turquoise. But the White Princess&rsquo; were
always pearls; and pearls often turn to tears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, drawing close to me, as I sat in the
long grass, she told me of</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw076.jpg" width="371" height="358"
alt="The White Princess." title="The White Princess." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;The fates had dowered Queen Catherine
with gifts; but though her husband was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
devoted to her, and the kingdom was blessed
by a long spell of peace, she sighed unceasingly.
One boon alone had been denied her,
and without this she did not care to live.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let her have her way!&rsquo; cried the Fates at
last, weary of her complainings. So one
summer dawn a babe was found in the bed
of lilies beneath her window, and now her
mourning was turned into joy. For a daughter
had been her heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>

<p>The little Princess was christened Fiorita,
but from the day of her birth she was known
as the White Princess. Her skin was as
purely pale as the petals of her guardian
flowers, and the yellow gold of their stamens
was the colour of her hair. But out of her
eyes looked a spirit that boded sorrow&mdash;the
spirit that would fain know all.</p>

<p>The White Princess grew lovelier day by
day, smiling but seldom, and staring for
hours at the distant line of the far horizon,
where the hills kept watch for ever over the
land Beyond. The Queen looked on with
delight at the unfolding of this tender blossom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
but her happiness did not bring strength, and
when in due time the sweet coral lips lisped
the soft word &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; her soul broke the
bonds which held it, and sped away.</p>

<p>Fiorita was now twice orphaned, for her
father, the King, would scarcely look at her,
since he connected her coming with the death
of his beloved wife. In order that the sight
of her might not continually remind him of
his sorrow, he built a fine tower of gold and
crystal, and here, surrounded by all her ladies,
the White Princess grew into womanhood.
Lovely as snow crystals, and cold as the
arctic wastes, Fiorita made few friends, and
spoke to none of her inmost thoughts. The
Kings of the Earth who came to woo her were
abashed by her strange white beauty, and
only the Prince Fiola remained to ask her hand.</p>

<p>He was brave as a lion, and gentle as a
woman, as true knights are to this very day.
The sound of his voice as he spake of his love
stirred the Princess&rsquo; heart to a secret joy; but
him, too, she sent away with but a glance from
her blue-grey eyes. And though I, her Fairy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>Godmother, scolded her well and entreated her
to say him yea, she would not be persuaded.</p>

<div class="figcenter2"><a name="ic007" id="ic007"></a>
<img src="images/ic007.jpg" width="350" height="464" alt="&ldquo;Lowered herself from her window by means of a rope of pearls&rdquo;" title="" />
<br /><span class="caption">&ldquo;Lowered herself from her window by means of a rope of
pearls&rdquo;</span>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;First I must see what lies hid in the land
Beyond,&rsquo; she said, and that very night, when
the Crystal Tower shone wanly in the moon-light,
and all her ladies were sleeping, the
Princess covered her snow-white robe with a
gossamer cloak of clouded grey, and lowered
herself from her window by means of a rope
of pearls, passing through her gardens and
into the forest, which lay between her and
the land Beyond. All fearless in her virgin
purity, she listened neither to the Goblins who
eyed her hungrily from the shapeless trees
and besought her to show them favour, nor
to the warnings of compassionate Fays who
bade her return to the Crystal Tower.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I seek the land Beyond,&rsquo; she cried, not
knowing that she could never reach it except
on spirit wings.</p>

<p>Now the Prince Fiola could not sleep for
love of her, and this night he stayed his
restless wanderings in the Palace grounds by
the waters of a placid lake, for the fancy came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to him that therein dwelt some kindly Sprite
who, perchance, would give him counsel and
further his suit. Clear shone the moon above,
making the smooth surface into a fairy mirror
which reflected the swaying trees and the
mysteries of forest depths; and as he looked,
the Prince descried the shape of a slim white
form which seemed to be hurrying onward
amidst a forest. The poise of the head was
Fiorita&rsquo;s; hers, too, was the queenly gait.
But thinking her to be safely sleeping, the
Prince believed that his eyes were cheating
him, and moodily resumed his walk. When
morning came, however, he hastened to the
Crystal Tower. He found it in great commotion.
Doors were opened and shut in rapid
succession, and scared attendants ran in and
out like ants.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Princess is not in her chamber!&rsquo; her
ladies told him, wringing their hands. &lsquo;Her
bed has not been slept on, and her silken
wrapper is still in its broidered case.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the Prince stood bewildered, the King
came up. The remembrance of his lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
love was heavy upon him, and he strove to
stifle his remorse by loud threatenings of dire
punishment to all if his daughter were not
speedily recovered.</p>

<p>As he stood quietly aside in the midst of
the commotion, Prince Fiola remembered the
vision of the lake, and bidding a groom go
fetch him a horse, he mounted and rode
straightway to the forest. Two paths stretched
out before him; his horse would have taken
that on the right, but the Prince urged it along
the other, for he thought that he caught a
glimpse of his love&rsquo;s white gown at the end
of a woodland glade.</p>

<p>It was only the feather of a dove, however,
and he pressed on, barely slackening his
pace for hours. Darkness fell, but there was
still no sign of Fiorita, and when he reached
the borders of the forest, and yet had found
no trace of her, his heart was sick at the
thought of her peril. He could not stop, so
with only the stars to guide him, he essayed
to cross the waste that lay beyond, and at
dawn was still riding wearily on. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
following noon both horse and rider were
exhausted. The burning sun blazed down on
their heads, smiting them as a sword, and
though the Prince had no pity on himself, he
grieved that his horse should suffer. Dismounting,
he led it on until he came to a great
rock, down the side of which flowed a stream
of water. When he and his dumb companion
had quenched their thirst, he took off its
bridle and set it free, for he knew that the
faithful creature could carry him no further.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make your way home, good friend,&rsquo; he said,
as he patted its glossy mane. &lsquo;I cannot return
without my Princess, though I fear me &rsquo;twill
be many a day before I find her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And now began the most toilsome part of
his journey. With the land Beyond always
before him, he trudged on and on, turning
aside for nothing; and so passed another day
and night. Now the long road wound uphill;
stones blocked his way, and thorns tore his
hands and face; still he pressed on, for his
love was stronger than hunger and thirst, and
pain had no terrors for him. Nevertheless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
he had lost all hope, when a turn in the path
disclosed a sight which made him for the
moment forget his trouble.</p>

<p>A bent old woman, crooked and frail,
staggered beneath a load of sticks, and dancing
along at either side of her, were two rough boys,
who mocked at her lameness, calling her a
Witch. The Prince overtook them with rapid
strides, and knowing that the power of gentleness
is more lasting than that of anger, he
suppressed his wrath as he spoke to them,
though withal he reproved them sternly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Know you not,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that only cowards
persecute those who are weaker than themselves?
&rsquo;Tis a woman whom you call
&lsquo;mother,&rsquo; and if only for this, you should hold
all women in reverence. Now go&mdash;and
remember what I have said. Here is something
to purchase a gift for your parents.
See that you are more worthy of their care.&rsquo;
And with other words to the same effect, he
gave each a silver coin.</p>

<p>Won alike by his kindness and the justice
of his rebuke, the boys asked pardon for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
their rudeness, and scampered off with glowing
faces, while the old woman blessed the Prince
for thus befriending her. Disclaiming her
thanks, he lifted her load to his own shoulders,
when it immediately became as light as air.
The next moment it fell from him altogether;
and he turned in great astonishment to meet
her serious gaze.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Bel giavone!</i>&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;I pray you
think me not intrusive, but I know by your
voice that your heart is heavy as the load I
carried awhile ago. Tell me your grief, that
if the Fates so will, I may in my turn help you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In truth, good mother,&rsquo; said the Prince,
&lsquo;no mortal can aid me now except by telling
me where I may find the White Princess,
whom I seek day and night in anguish, since
she is my dear love.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Even that can I do!&rsquo; cried the old woman,
straightening her bent figure until she stood
before him tall and queenly, her squalid rags
changing into flowing robes of purple velvet.
&lsquo;I am the Witch Lucretia, and my spells are
a match for those of the Sorcerer with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
Seven Heads. You have travelled far from
your White Princess, for the Sorcerer lurks
in the forest through which you passed, and
Fiorita is his prisoner. No man yet has
entered his castle to leave it alive, but I will
show you how this may be done, if you are
willing to change your shape and become one
of Earth&rsquo;s humblest creatures.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prince feared nothing so that he might
once reach the side of Fiorita, and gladly
submitted himself to the enchantments of the
Witch. Lucretia lifted the silver wand that
was hid in the fold of her gown, and at its
touch the Prince became a cricket, just such
another as the one which you lately restored
to liberty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will find no difficulty now,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;in entering the Sorcerer&rsquo;s castle, for the pitfalls
he has prepared for man are as nought
to they who traverse the air. And that you
may be one of many, and so a match for his
spells, I will summon my Witches and Fairies
to protect you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having muttered an incantation, she blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
thrice on an opalescent shell which dangled
from her waist upon a ruby chain; and troops
of Fays and Witches came hurrying down
the road. Some were slender and stately, with
faces as fair as dreamland; some were twisted
and bent, and some so small that a dozen
could hide in the cup of a flower. With a
second wave of her silver wand, Lucretia
transformed them into a myriad crickets.
Hailing Fiola as their king, she placed him
at their head, and reminding him solemnly
that persistence conquers where force must
fail, bade him lead them back to the forest.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time this aerial army
arrived at the castle of the Sorcerer with the
Seven heads. It stood in the midst of a dense
thicket, surrounded by a moat, the lurking
place of demons with long forked tongues,
and eyes that shot evil fires. Undaunted by
their snarls, the crickets flew over the draw-bridge,
and finding a way into the castle
through the close-barred windows, swarmed
round the Sorcerer&rsquo;s head. A cauldron swung
from the domed ceiling, over a quenchless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
fire, and in this the wretch was even then
concocting a potion by which he should
overcome Fiorita. Her purity had hitherto
protected her, and though he had bound her
body with chains, he could not fetter her
spirit.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="ibw077" id="ibw077"></a>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;How dare you disturb me?&rsquo; he roared,
lunging at the crickets vainly with a long and
glittering knife.</p>

<p>Fiola would fain have slain him where he
stood, but when, forgetting his impotence, he
hurled himself forward at the monster, he
only tickled his nose.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Leave him to us!&rsquo; cried his cricket friends;
and then they began their witch-song of
&lsquo;<em>Cree-cree-cree</em>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the Sorcerer having seven heads&mdash;Greed,
Envy, Spite, Malice, Passion, Jealousy,
and Despair, each of which would have
instantly sprung forth again had Fiola been
able to chop it off&mdash;he had naturally fourteen
ears, and these were so extraordinarily
sensitive to noise that he had destroyed all the
woodpeckers in the forest that he might not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
hear their tap-tap on the trees as they searched
the bark for insects. You can judge, then, of
his disgust when on his refusal to obey
Lucretia&rsquo;s command, and break the bonds
which held Fiorita, this host of crickets
swarmed round his head, and filled the air
with discord. Each pitched his voice in a
different key, and the din of battle was as
nothing to that which now pervaded the castle.</p>

<p>These were the words of the witch-song:</p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;<em>Cree-cree-cree-cree</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set Fiola&rsquo;s Princess free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorcerer thou, but Witches we&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cricket-Witches, from grass and ditches.<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><em>Cree-cree-cree-cree!</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace thine ears no more shall know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou bidst the lady go.<br /></span>
<span class="i4"><em>Cree-cree-cree-cree!</em><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Sorcerer, set the lady free!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Over and over again they chanted this lay,
and every cricket, far and near, joined in the
maddening chorus. They sang until the
Sorcerer with the Seven Heads felt that his
senses were leaving him; pallid with rage,
he severed the White Princess&rsquo;s chains. By
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>the power of Lucretia, who had clearly foreseen
his discomforture, the moment that the
chains fell from her Fiorita immediately
became a cricket also, and gladly did she fly
to the side of the Prince, who greeted her
with rapture.</p>

<p>All would now have been well had they
straightway left the castle, for Lucretia
waited outside to restore to them their human
form. As Fiorita passed the great cauldron
which still swung over the lamp, she could
not resist the temptation to lean over and
peep inside, and the fumes from the potion
being very strong, she straightway fainted,
falling into the midst of the blood-red liquid.
Before it could wholly cover her, the Cricket
King seized her wings in his mouth; he
carried her thus into the open air, where she
speedily revived. Great was Lucretia&rsquo;s concern,
however, when she heard from Fiola
what had happened.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas,&rsquo; she sighed, &lsquo;not even I, who am
mistress of spells and enchantments, can
avert from Fiorita the consequences of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
delay. Since the Sorcerer&rsquo;s potion touched her,
for six months each year she must be a cricket,
even as now; for the rest, she will be the
White Princess, to dwell with you where you
will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Fiorita was sad indeed, for she had
lost her longing to see the land Beyond, and
desired nothing better than to wed the Prince.
But now that he knew she loved him, no
spell could dampen Fiola&rsquo;s joy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;While you are a cricket,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I will
be one too, for so long as you are beside me&mdash;what
matters else?&rsquo; And the Fays and
Witches, who reverence all true love, elected
to share their banishment.</p>

<p>And so it was, and is to this present time.
For half the year Fiola is the Cricket King,
and Fiorita, more than content, his Queen.
But as Ascension day comes round, the spell
is broken, and they take their accustomed
places at the Court. It is hard to say when
they are the happier; for love is as much at
home in the humblest corner of Mother Earth
as it is in a lordly Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One night there was not a breath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
air, and I could not sleep. I tossed this way
and that for hours, and directly the birds began
to twitter, I put on my things and slipped back
the bolt of the grand hall door. Once outside,
it was beautifully fresh and cool, and the clouds
in the sky were like wreaths of pink flowers
on a turquoise sea, arched over with gleaming
gold. They changed every moment, and while
I watched them I forgot to look where I was
going. When I stopped at last I found myself
in the middle of the market place, where
I had been with Father the day before.</p>

<p>It was empty now, for no one was yet
awake but me.</p>

<p>Among the quaint old wooden houses I
noticed one that I had not seen before; at first
it seemed to be indistinct, but the longer I
stared at it, the clearer it grew. Over the door
of the tiny shop was the figure of a hen cut into
the stone, and while I was wondering who had
carved it, the wings fluttered gently toward me.
The bird moved its head, and its wings were
lifted; it flew to the ground, and a lovely white
hen was at my feet. It looked at me wistfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and flew away; when I turned to the little
house once again, it was not there. But beside
me stood the Fairy Godmother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and sit in the shade,&rdquo; she said, when
I asked her what had become of the hen, &ldquo;and
I will tell you all about her. She is seeking
Furicchia, whom she served so well, not
knowing that she is a shadow too.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/ibw080.jpg" width="227" height="211" alt="Furicchia and her hen" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw081.jpg" width="373" height="357" alt="The Enchanted Hen" title="The Enchanted Hen" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Furicchia,&rdquo; said the Fairy Godmother,
&ldquo;was a very poor woman who owned a hen
which an innkeeper greatly coveted. The
shape of the bird was perfect; it had a
most melodious voice, and its feathers were
glossy and white as snow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Come now, good dame,&rsquo; the man cried,
persuasively, &lsquo;I will give you double the
market value of your little hen, for I wish
to make a present of her to the widow Ursula,
whom I intend to espouse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But the widow might kill and eat her!&rsquo;
said Furicchia, looking lovingly at the little
hen, which she had brought up by hand from
a tiny chick. It had slept beneath her best
silk &rsquo;kerchief, and taken its food from her lips.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is as may be,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Come,
Furicchia, I make you a handsome offer. Give
me the hen, and you shall fare well next feast
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Furicchia would not listen, in spite of
the sad fact that her cupboard was as empty
as her netted purse. The little hen was dear
to her, though as yet it had lain no eggs, and
she would not sacrifice her to her needs.</p>

<p>Ere evening came, Coccodé was clucking
gaily under the kitchen table, and Furicchia
found, not one egg, but three, all a rich coffee
brown, and polished like porcelain. Having
joyfully exchanged one with a neighbour for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a dish of broth, she broke the second into it,
and prudently saving the third for next day,
thankfully made a good meal. When morning
came, she found eggs to the number of a round
dozen strewn about her tiny room, and from
being almost on the verge of starvation, she
had plenty now and to spare. For Coccodé,
the grateful creature, laid eggs by the score,
and not only were they of exquisite flavour
and very large, but it was noticed that if sick
folk ate them, they straightway returned to
health.</p>

<p>Furicchia was now a famous egg-wife, and
the more eggs she sold, the more eggs Coccodé
laid. The little hen was both willing and
industrious, and loved her kind mistress so
dearly that she was never so happy as when
helping to make her fortune. Her pride in
Furicchia&rsquo;s first silk gown was comical to
witness; she rustled her wings against its
handsome folds, and clucked so loudly that
the neighbours heard, and came to see what
was the matter.</p>

<p>This silken gown it was that roused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
anger of the Signora, a wealthy woman who
had much, and knew no better than to want
more. Hearing of the prodigious number of
eggs which Furicchia supplied, though no one
had ever seen her with other than a single
hen, she set afoot much scandal concerning
her, ending by declaring her to be an evil
Witch. At this, Furicchia&rsquo;s neighbours began
to look askance at her; but the eggs were so
good, and so moderate in price, that on second
thoughts they decided to treat the Signora&rsquo;s
hints with the contempt which they deserved.</p>

<p>This made the lady still more angry; she
resolved to find out Furicchia&rsquo;s secret, and
ruin her if she could, so that she might obtain
her customers for her own eggs. Coccodé was
quite aware of what was going on, and before
her mistress went out one morning she bade
her fetch certain herbs that grew on a corner
of barren land, and put these on the fire in a
pot of wine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now, dear mistress,&rsquo; she continued,
when all had been done as she said, &lsquo;do you
go out and trust your luck to Coccodé.&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Furicchia had not long been gone, when
the Signora&rsquo;s crafty face peeped slyly round
the door. Finding the room apparently empty,
she hurried in, delighted at such an opportunity
for prying. First she peered here, and then
she peered there, ransacking Furicchia&rsquo;s chests,
and even turning over the leaves of her holy
books, that she might see if an incantation to
Witches had been written therein. Finally,
she raised the latch of the inner chamber,
where she had heard Coccodé clucking.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have found out Furicchia&rsquo;s secret now,&rsquo;
she thought with glee. &lsquo;Her little white hen
is under a spell, and she and it shall be
burnt as Witches.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Coccodé was sitting on a pile of eggs that
reached almost up to the ceiling, and even as
she clucked she was laying more. The
Signora drew close to her, and listened with
all her ears, for she had distinguished words
amidst her cluckings, and immediately jumped
to the conclusion that Coccodé believed herself
to be addressing her mistress. This is what
she heard:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<div class="centered"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0b">&lsquo;Coccodé! now there are nine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring me quickly the warm red wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Coccodé! take them away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many more for thee will I lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt be a lady grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fine as any in the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And should it happen that any one<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eggs like me she shall surely lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the secret, this is the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Coccodé! Coccodé!&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the Signora joyfully, &lsquo;now I
have it!&rsquo; And running back to the outer room,
she lifted the wine off the fire and drank it,
every drop, though it scalded her throat and
made her choke. As it coursed through her
veins she felt a most extraordinary sensation,
and hurried home as quickly as she could.
A meal was laid on the table, but she found
great difficulty in taking her usual place, and
could eat nothing but some brown bread,
which she pecked at in a most curious manner.
As the charm began to work, her legs grew
thinner and thinner, and her feet so large that
she had to cut off her boots. Next, her brown
silk dress became a bundle of draggled feathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>while her nose turned into a beak, and her voice
into a discordant cluck; in short, she was just
a scraggy brown hen, and her friends held up
their hands in horror. Eggs she laid by the
score, but before she could sit on them they turned
to mice and ran away. So she had nothing for
all her trouble; and though she possessed a
handsome house, she could only perch in a barn.</p>

<p>This is what comes of greed and envy, and
of meddling with other people&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just at this moment a girl darted out of a
doorway opposite, followed by an elderly woman
who loudly reproved her for refusing to do her
share in some household task. Shrugging
her shoulders, she came to a sudden end, as
if she knew that her breath was wasted, and
the girl disappeared with a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is off to gossip instead of work,&rdquo; said
the Fairy Godmother disapprovingly. &ldquo;She
will pay for it later, will pretty Ursula, for
the Fates are not likely to interfere on her
behalf as they did for Pepita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to coax her to tell me this story, for she
said she had much to do, and could not stay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
But when she heard that the very next day
Father and I were leaving Italy, she refused
no more. We sat down on the step of a
splendid church, and no one seemed to notice us.</p>

<div class="figcenter1">
<img src="images/ibw082.jpg" width="375" height="359"
alt="The Favourite of the Fates." title="The Favourite of the Fates." />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Troubles rolled off Pepita as water from
a duck&rsquo;s back. So lighthearted and full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
good humour was she that nought ever seemed
to vex her, and no one living had ever heard
an unkind word fall from her rosy lips. Even
the three grim Fates, who rule over mortal
destinies, relaxed their stern brows as they
looked down on her, and smiled indulgently.</p>

<p>Pepita was slender as a swallow, with a
warm red flush on her olive cheeks, and dainty
hands that looked far too delicate and small
for even the lighter household tasks. These,
indeed, Pepita seldom attempted, singing
instead from morn to eve, and charming her
mother with soft caresses when she hardened
her heart and tried to scold her.</p>

<p>But Pepita could spin. Ah yes, she could
spin, and as no other maiden had ever been
known to do since Arachne was changed
into a spider. The snowy flax flew from
under her fingers as though her distaff were
enchanted; which, indeed, was the case, for
the wayward Fates had bestowed upon her a
magic gift, and having given her this, not
even they could take it away from her.</p>

<p>Pepita&rsquo;s mother was often wroth with her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
for the dame had much work on her hands,
and sighed that her only daughter should give
her so little help. Were the maiden sent to
wash clothes in the stream, ten chances to one
they would go floating down the current while
she twisted flowers in her hair. Were she
set to make sweet little chestnut cakes, she
would forget to put a cool green leaf at the
bottom of each round baking dish, and when
they were taken out of the ashes, behold, they
would be all burnt!</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are a good-for-nothing!&rsquo; her mother
would cry angrily; but this was not true, for
Pepita could spin.</p>

<p>One feast day, while her mother went to the
fair, she was told to watch the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentola</i>, and
to stir it carefully if it boiled too fast. It was
made of rice and good fresh meat, with
vegetables from the little garden; and it smelt
so delicious that Pepita&rsquo;s small nostrils quivered
like the petals of a rose on a windy day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will taste it to see that all is well,&rsquo; she
murmured, and drawing back the iron pot,
she helped herself to a liberal portion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentola</i> was good; Pepita tasted it yet
again, for she had been up early to go to
Mass, and had sung herself hungry on the
way home. Soon there was no meat left.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, what shall I do?&rsquo; she sighed, &lsquo;My
mother will scold me terribly, and will tell
the Padre that I am greedy.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was sighing still when her eyes fell on
an old leather shoe which had been cast away
behind the door. Her face all dimpled with
mischief, Pepita soused this under a tap, and
threw it into the soup.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They will but think that the meat is
tough!&rsquo; she cried with a burst of laughter;
but as the shoe fell into the boiling liquid her
mother crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; demanded she,
peering into the pot. &rsquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madonnamia!</i> Was
ever an honest woman cursed with such a
daughter?&rsquo; And breathing out angry hopes
that an Ogre would come and take her, she
drove Pepita out of the house.</p>

<p>At that moment a rich young merchant
was strolling by, and Pepita unwittingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
rushed into his arms. A thing such as this
had never happened to him before, and since
he scarce knew what to do, he clasped her
tightly while he considered. By the time he
released her, Pepita&rsquo;s face was pink as apple
blossom, and the tears that sparkled on it
were for all the world like dewdrops on the
petals of a flower. Something stirred in his
breast, and he blushed even more than she;
for when a man falls suddenly in love he
knows not where he stands. Looking from
one to the other, the wrath of Pepita&rsquo;s mother
suddenly cooled.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Take her to wife,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;ll not
get a bad bargain. True, she is nought in
the house, but she can spin. And with all
her faults she is not a scold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;One wants more in a wife than that!&rsquo; said
the merchant shrewdly, though the last of her
statements went far with him, since his mother
had a tongue. Looking into Pepita&rsquo;s eyes,
which were heavenly blue, and sweet as an
angel&rsquo;s, he lost his last qualm of doubt, and
lifted her hand to his lips. Then he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
once more to the elder woman. &lsquo;I have
vowed to my mother I will not wed without
her free consent, but if your daughter meets
with her approval, I will gladly do as you say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Guido&rsquo;s mother was in her seventieth year,
and though she had never beheld a face more
winning than merry Pepita&rsquo;s, it did not please
her, and she gave her mind to finding a task
which would prove beyond her powers.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The garden paths are green with weeds,&rsquo;
she quavered; &lsquo;they have been sadly neglected
since Pietro fell ill. Take the hoe, and root
them up; leave not a single one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nay, mother! I seek not a gardener for
my wife!&rsquo; her son protested hotly, for Pepita&rsquo;s
small hands could barely lift the hoe, and he
had set his heart on her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Unless the paths be clear of weeds ere the
sun sets, I will not give thee my consent,&rsquo;
said the old woman obstinately; and there
was nothing left for Pepita to do but to hoe up
the weeds as best she could.</p>

<p>No sooner had Guido&rsquo;s mother ceased
watching her from the window, than Pepita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
whistled gently, and swift at her call came the
birds she had fed with crumbs when the
fields were bare. Pointing to the weeds, she
made signs to them to destroy them, and by
the time the old mother awoke from her nap,
not one was left behind. This vexed her
instead of giving her pleasure, for she did not
wish her son to marry, and telling her maids
they might have a holiday, she commanded
Pepita to prepare the evening meal.</p>

<p>The maiden was now in much perplexity,
for she knew not how to cook, and her
experience that morning with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pentola</i> had
taught her little. But the Brownies who
dwelt behind the hearth, and love to see a fair
young face bending over the pots and pans,
bade her be not discouraged, for they would
stand her friends.</p>

<p>Then the nimble little men flew hither and
thither, fetching garlic and oil and meat and
rice in just the proportions that Guido loved,
and adding certain secret flavours of their own
until the smell of the broth made the old
woman&rsquo;s mouth water, and she could not but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
praise Pepita&rsquo;s cooking. When it came to
the time to test her skill at spinning, she was
completely reconciled to her son&rsquo;s choice, and
put no obstacles in the way of the wedding.</p>

<p>And now Pepita sang more blithely than
ever, for though he was less well favoured,
and slower of speech than many a young
man who had wooed her, she adored her
husband. She was as happy as the day was
long until, wishing to have the biggest bank
account as well as the prettiest wife in the
neighbourhood, he took it into his head to
turn her talent for spinning to account, and
kept her beside her distaff from morn till eve.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall soon, at this rate, be richer even
than the notary,&rsquo; he thought, as he looked
delighted at his stores of flax; and Pepita
besought him in vain to give her a little rest,
for he could be as obstinate as his mother.</p>

<p>It was now that the Fates interfered on her
behalf, though many more worthy than she
are left to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She has lost her bloom!&rsquo; sighed one grim
sister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Her cheeks are hollow!&rsquo; observed the
second.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Her songs are sad ones!&rsquo; said the third
with a dreadful frown. And then they put
their heads together, and formed a plan whereby
Guido might be outwitted.</p>

<p>As he sat in the doorway that evening while
Pepita span, denying himself the sight of her
in order that her work might not be disturbed,
there came up the garden path a hideous old
hag, who besought him to give her alms.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look at me, Signor!&rsquo; she groaned, lifting
her head so that he saw the wrinkled folds
that lapped her chin. &lsquo;Once I was fair as
your Pepita, but I sat so long at my spinning
wheel, that all my comeliness left me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Guido hastily gave her a coin, and urged
her to begone; for he did not want Pepita to
see her, or to hear what she had to say.</p>

<p>Next eve came a second old woman, uglier,
if possible, than the last, and bent like some
brutish beast. She had the same story to tell
him of bygone loveliness, and Guido sped her
down the hill with even more haste than before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The next night a third old woman appeared,
so dread of aspect that he was obliged to avert
his gaze. Against his wish, he felt himself
constrained to enquire the cause of her terrible
affliction.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I sat at my wheel, good master,&rsquo; was the
reply, &lsquo;until beauty and sight both left me,
and my skin became even as you see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now thoroughly alarmed, he dismissed her
quickly with a handful of coins, and calling
Pepita to him, gazed at her long and
searchingly. When the flush that his now
unaccustomed touch had brought to her sweet
face faded, he saw she was pale and thin.
Her mouth drooped sadly, and purple shadows
brooded round her eyes. With a cry of
remorse he drew her to his breast, and kissed
her tenderly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shall spin no longer, my Pepita,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;for I would rather have you as you are
than be rich as Satan himself!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this was the very last story I heard.
We started for home next morning, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
went to school at the half term&mdash;a ripping
school where there was any amount of
cricket, and so many other games that I had
no time to think of Fairies.</p>

<p>But some day I&rsquo;m going to find the Peri,
and those other wonderful Sprites and
Goblins of which Titania told me when I
met her in the wood that Christmas day.</p>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
